6.7/10While "Nope" is a visual spectacle I found that it didn't sit as well as I would've hoped when it came to the story. However, it still manages to reach its goal of entertaining on some level.The film felt slightly long due to the first and third acts feeling fast and somewhat stuffed with a lot of goings ons while the second act felt very slow and drawn out. The long parts put me into a state of boredom, and even further than that, once the reveal of the antagonist happened, the magic and tension disappeared. Before that tension disappeared I found there was some good tension built up due to the soundtrack, but again, things fell short.As for the horror parts, I assumed there would be more than just the ones shown in the commercial, and while there was, again a lot of the horror/magic disappeared once the antagonist was shown.I did find the acting to be very engaging. Daniel Kaluuya and Keke Palmer each brought great energy to their roles, and the supporting actors were equally enjoyable.Overall, a decent film, but if I could go back I would wait to see it on a cheap night. Acting was enjoyable, the cinematography was spectacular, but the story, the length of the film, and the antagonist weren't up to the par I was expecting.Thank you for reading my review. Until next time.... Enjoy the show!

I've been dragging my feet on typing out my thoughts on Nope for almost a month because it has me completely puzzled. Frankly, the film has aged like milk in my mind. After initially thinking it was a pretty good film when I came home from the theater, time has passed and I have begun to question what I was even thinking. I'll at least give it credit for being more compelling than Us because it didn't get so bogged down in trying to create an allegory that the story of the film was lost. However, it is light years away from the genius of Get Out and has me wondering if Jordan Peele was a one-hit wonder. Most of the rest of this review will be considered spoilers, so if you don't know anything about the plot of this movie and don't want to know, then stop reading here.The best part of Nope was the unique design of the alien, and how it takes on multiple forms depending on the situation. I greatly appreciated that they didn't go with the same old designs that we've all seen a hundred times before. I also have to give some credit to the originality of this idea, focusing an entire movie on animal training. I like some of the history we are given of the practice and how they work closely with the horses in order to create the perfect conditions so that the animals will do what the director wants them to do. But the idea that the techniques he uses for horses will have a direct correlation to what is needed for an alien is about as plausible as Jeff Goldblum giving an alien ship a computer virus with a laptop in the 1990s.I had some massive struggles with the erratic behavior of the alien in Nope, because it implies the thing is unpredictable, yet they seem to figure out everything they need to do in order to get the "Oprah shot." Speaking of which, it bothered me tremendously that they made such a big thing about Keke Palmer's character getting the picture at the end when they already had an entire roll of film to use as evidence (which will be far more compelling than a still shot.) It's just shoddy writing and one of many things that seem to happen in the film for no other reason than the movie needed it to happen. But the single most damning thing I can say about Nope is that a minor subplot we only see through flashbacks is far more interesting than anything that happens with the alien. I shouldn't be wishing I could go back and learn more about that one moment in the past when I'm seeing everything play out in the present. I can't say Nope is bad, it's just underwhelming, which is a shame.

It starts off a little humorous, thought the directing was great to take it from there into a more tense, on edge film. I however don't think this is horror, more of sci-fi but unlike sci-fi movies this one didn't really expose much of the otherworldly parts of it, which was great in the beginning because it built up suspense but since we don't learn much about the "alien" you're left with more questions than answers which annoyed me. Thought the premise of the movie was going to be hard to pull off since it's set in the middle of nowhere but they did. Story telling is good and paced well, I love how they added the chimpanzee story arc but I'm disappointed that was the most gruesome part in the movie. You don't get to see how the alien got there, why OJ somehow figured it's territorial, what is actually happening inside the ship, or how Jupe and his wife's circus ruckus never stirred up more attention on previous occasions.... in short, it lacks depth and I think it would have elavated it from just a good movie to a great one.The performances were amazing, loved how calm Kaluya's character was, felt realistic for me. It's often said black people don't usually feature in horrors because once something's fishy we dip, but if we didn't I think this was a more realistic take by the whole cast, upped the rating for me. Peele's concept and directing was great, it was great to see a horror that's not leaning on jump-scares. But as I said this isn't a horror, not in the typical sense of making you scared to turn off the lights to sleep; but it's the nearest genre you could put it in other than sci-fi. I think movies like this, or The invisible man, Ready or not, Midsommer, Fresh, maybe even Us aren't really horrors and a sub genre should be found; because you expect to be scared when you watch a horror so it feels mis-categorized. Nope felt more like a psychological sci-fi thriller or drama than actual horror.There was a good movie in here, it just needed more development and depth to go along with everything else the movie did right, it's like when you have a brilliant idea but don't think it through in detail so it just comes off shallow.

"Nope" is the next disappointment by Jordan Peele who, with each movie, seems to look more and more like a one hit wonder. "Get Out" was an incredible thriller that fired on every cylinder and hit every note; "Us" had a phenomenal trailer, but seemed to confuse audiences with its convoluted and borderline pretentious ending where, the more you think about things, the less sense they make. "Nope" follows that same vein, and I can't help but think that Peele feels as if he needs to shock and awe when, perhaps, a more simple, straightforward tale would have worked better."Nope" is two hours and ten minutes long, so you could say that this isn't a short, breezy film. And I don't necessarily have a problem with that. The problem is, however, that "Nope" doesn't have much to say, do, or tell within that lengthy run time. A slow burn to its very core, "Nope" takes its sweet time setting up the story that it wants to tell - scratch that, though, because there isn't much of a story here in the first place. If you've seen the second trailer for this film, you know that it's about two ranchers who seem to witness an unidentified flying object in the skies above and, as they are both down on their luck and strapped for cash, they decide to set up some cameras in hopes of capturing said UFO on film so they can sell the footage. An interesting, if bare bones, premise to be sure, but surely one that gives way to the real meat, hook, and plot of the film, no?Nope. The story never gets any grander or more unique than its initial set up. Sure, there is a subplot that is, granted, pretty intense, leading to a few unique and twisted scenes, but it hardly adds anything to the movie except an added running time. Without spoilers, the subplot has to do with a certain animal; while I understood what they were going for, I couldn't help but wonder why the scenes didn't get cut in editing to create a tighter, more focused story, as I imagine the entire point of the subplot will fly over the heads of many.The simple premise wouldn't be a problem if the film led to a bombastic and satisfying conclusion, but it doesn't. Throwing its simple premise out the window to instead attempt to surprise audiences with a twist that is somehow more underwhelming than my life, "Nope" devolves into a parody of itself by the end. I don't want to spoil anything, but I do want to say that the final act reveal takes all mystery, suspense, tension, and horror out of the picture completely - I literally couldn't believe my eyes; I mean, who thought what they did would be a good idea on any level, especially visually? Let's just say that, in this case, less would have been more."Nope" was a disappointment to me, and is further proof that Jordan Peele is - sadly - becoming a one hit wonder. A tighter, more streamlined and focused story would've worked wonders here, especially in helping to create the horror film that this movie was advertised as being. It pains me to say, however, that viewers may not find the contents of the film horrifying as much as they may find themselves scared of "Nope's" utter mediocrity.

The way most critics are raving about "Nope" makes me wonder if I've been the victim of an elaborate prank where I was shown a different film than what they have been watching.Because "Nope" is, at best, adequate -- a watchable sci-fi action picture that, if it weren't for the fact that it's directed by an Oscar-winning red-hot director and has a budget of roughly $60 mil and stars an Oscar-winning actor, would not be out of place among the myriad of B-movies that litter the virtual shelves of Netflix or Prime Video.First, the good stuff: the film looks gorgeous. Lots of beautiful shots of cloudy skies and spectacular night and day vistas. It was shot on Imax cameras by a master (Hoyte Van Hoytema, Christopher Nolan's regular cinematographer), and it shows. And the dark, foreboding imagery helps Jordan Peele build some effective tension during the first half of the film, when the audience (and the film's characters) still don't know exactly what's going on and what exactly is threatening them.But then the film devolves into a mess where everyone (including the main antagonist) behaves illogically because that's what the plot requires them to do in order to hit all the subtextual marks that Jordan Peele wants them to deliver. And therein lies the biggest problem with the film: it's a very unsubtle 'message' movie, and Jordan Peele, really wants you to get what he's trying to say, to the point of driving the point home with a hammer, over and over.Without going into spoiler territory, the film's plot is a not-so-veiled metaphor for the state of entertainment in our society. All the characters have some sort of connection to the entertainment industry in some form and/or are meant to symbolize a facet of it: the protagonists are two African American siblings, one of whom runs the family business, a ranch providing horses for Hollywood movies; the other is a wannabe performer/entertainer.Their business is dying: animals are being supplanted by CGI, and horses can be unpredictable on set and hard to control, and therefore replaceable. Any parallel with the perception of people of color in the same industry is of course not accidental. Then you have the kid who works at (now defunct) Fry's Electronics and is all about digital videos and streaming content. His name is Angel, probably because calling him YouTube or TikTok would have been a tad too transparent. Then there's the the grizzled, obsessed old filmmaker (played by Michael Wincott, your go-to guy when you want someone who looks gruff and curmudgeonly, down to the 'I just swallowed drain cleaner' hoarse voice) who is disillusioned with the drivel he's forced to shoot nowadays and is ready to roll with his trusty hand-cranked non-digital film camera and to sacrifice everything to the altar of cinematic art.We also have the Asian cowboy slash circus entertainer (Steven Yeun) who suffered a traumatic event as a child actor which left him with deep unhealed psychological scars simmering under the surface, which all stereotypical ex-child actors are supposed to have and which of course will lead him to make horribly wrong, life-changing decisions. And, in what is the most transparent cypher in film packed to the gills with them, you have a TMZ reporter that is not even given a name or a face: he just shows up at some point on an electric motorcycle wearing a reflective helmet (get it? He's just mirroring society's obsession with capturing celebrities' life! Hoo boy!) and expensive cameras. And of course we all know how Hollywood feels about paparazzi, so if you can't guess what's going to happen to him, you will love this film unironically.Nobody in the film behaves the way a regular human being would. They do things because Jordan Peele needs them to deliver a message to the audience, logic and common sense be damned. I'm not even sure the film takes place in the real world, since all the events seem to involve only this microcosm of characters and nobody else. It's like a Beckett play, except that the stage is a vast valley in the California desert inhabited only by a handful of people and the outside world doesn't exist and is somehow unaware of the very visible and bizarre events taking place.Imagine if Jaws took place in the California desert and the shark had a message against Hollywood and showbiz consumerism painted in bright neon letters on its side, and Brody, Quint and Hooper were replaced by much less competent characters whose purpose is not to kill the man-eating menace but to take pictures of it so they can sell it to Oprah and become rich, and you'll have a pretty good idea of the basic plot of "Nope" (and the Jaws comparisons don't end there -- you'll see what I mean at the end of the film).As a scary movie, Nope is pretty devoid of actual scares (Peele has to resort to the oldest trick in the book, the 'jump scare', in a couple of occasions). It's also surprising tame in the blood and gore department (most of the carnage takes place offscreen).The talented cast does what they can with the material. Daniel Kaluuya's OJ is nicely understated: a no-nonsense guy who seems to react to most of the craziness around him with a shrug or by saying "nope" (of course). Kiki Palmer is fine as his sister, though in typically cliched fashion, she suddenly switches from "shrieking, terrified woman" to "resourceful heroine" when the plot demands it. But they can't save the film because they have to go through the motions of a plot that becomes increasingly preposterous (the plan that they devise in the third act makes no sense the more you think about it)
Nope continues the downward trajectory of Jordan Peele after Get Out and Us. The former, still a modern masterpiece, succeeded because the metaphorical subtext didn't get in the way of the plot: even if you completely ignored the clear references to slavery and race relationships, it still worked perfectly as a basic thriller.Us was where we started getting hints Peele's ambition might exceed his grasp (it was deliciously creepy and well executed, but the basic concept of a race of "alternate" underground dwelling doppelgangers was too bonkers and forced to work)
And now we have Nope, where nothing makes sense outside of its function as a delivery system for Peele's criticism of Hollywood, its treatment of minorities, and our society's total dependence on entertainment at all costs.I've seen critics make favorable comparison between Jordan Peele and Steven Spielberg (mainly due to the very evident influence of Close Encounters of the Third Kind and the aforementioned "Jaws), but a more apt comparison would be with M. Night Shyamalan, another director who hit the jackpot early in his career with a terrific movie and then proceeded to squander his potential with increasingly ambitious and less effective muddled message films.In many ways, Nope is Jordan Peele's "Signs". Still enjoyable in parts, but too self-conscious for its own good and a far cry from the promise shown with Get Out.

Original, creative, creepy and suspenseful. Jordan Peele continues to show off his skills as a director. From a technical perspective, this is top-notch across the board. The way sound is strategically used is masterful. My only downsides with the movie are the comedy not always working (not as much as with Get Out), and it taking a little while to get going. But after really disliking Us, I see this as a major bounce-back.I strongly recommend avoiding trailers or any plot details. I went in knowing absolutely nothing other than "Jordan Peele." Going through the story as it unfolds and discovering what it's about is such a fun experience. I also recommend seeing it in IMAX since some scenes have an expanded aspect ratio. If not IMAX then any premium screen that will enhance the sound and images.EDIT: I liked Nope even better on second viewing. I noticed so many little details as well as repeated references to the main theme, resulting in a much better flow. And I didn't feel any slowness early in the movie like I did the first time, possibly because I was expecting it and knew it was worth it. Changing rating from 7 to 8 stars. (2 viewings, opening Thursday IMAX 7/21/2022, IMAX 8/3/2022)SPOILERSSPOILERSSPOILERSThis movie reminds me a lot of Signs. The way the suspense levels are through the roof in the horror moments. The way the movie is so confined with a small cast, yet feels huge. And the way various story elements and details come together at the end, with credit going to good writing. After making this connection, I found out that Jordan Peele specifically said Signs was one of his inspirations for Nope.Once I realized the movie is about aliens, I started wondering what direction they would go for the look of the aliens. We've seen so many versions that it's difficult to come up with something new or creative. But instead of the typical humanoid creatures or something like Zerg from StarCraft or Starship Troopers, he goes in a completely different direction with the entire UFO being a single alien being. Talk about thinking outside the box. When it opens up during the climax, it looks incredible.Also, I was so happy/impressed when I realized the climax would take place during daytime so we could see everything.The part with the chimp does not seem vital to the plot (at first glance, at least). This would normally be a downside, but I think there are two reasons it works. One is that the scene is unbelievably creepy and jaw-dropping. And two, it does connect to a couple themes. It parallels the alien behavior with predatory tendencies, being territorial, and not looking it in the eyes. And the irony of Jupe doing the same thing as an adult as he did as a child, dealing with a beast he couldn't control, once again resulting in disaster.There is probably a lot more to be explored. I look forward to watching it again and then checking out some explained/explored videos on youtube.EDIT: I am writing this before watching any explored videos. On second viewing, I noticed the theme of not being able to control a beast is touched on throughout the movie, even as early as the commercial shoot. Same with the theme of spectacle/wanting to be seen. I didn't make all the connections the first time.I originally didn't think much of the shoe standing up. But they show it a few times, intentionally. And I don't believe there is evidence of anything supernatural. So that got me thinking. And I have a theory.The probability of a nickel landing on its side is estimated to be one in 6,000. It seems almost impossible. But if you drop a nickel repeatedly, it's not only probable, it's nearly inevitable. As number of drops goes to infinity, probability of landing on its side goes to 100%.If we assume that's what the shoe represents, how does it connect to the movie? Apply that same logic to the theme of not being able to control a beast. No matter how well-tamed, no matter how long you've built trust, no matter how unlikely it is for something to cause it to become ultra aggressive, on a long enough timeline it becomes an inevitability.I could be way off, but it's cool to think about.

This may be the most apropos title for a movie in the history of the cinema, as in nope, don't bother to see it.How may I put this succinctly. Ah, yes. Giant, predatory, carnivorous alien-jellyfish-amoeba that won't eat you if you don't look at it. With this submission, Jordan Peele may very well be cementing his claim as the next M. Night Shamylan, and that isn't meant as a compliment.I had a choice between "NOPE" and " The Black Phone". I should have gone to see "The Black Phone" instead.
46e57#$sw%%62$45@
I'm not really sure what I just saw. This has to be one of the weirdest movies I've ever seen. As per usual, Peele raises a ton of questions in his film without touching anywhere close to the answers. And let's face it, it's the same premise as Tremors, only it's in the sky. Nothing really amazingly new or anything. Just weird. The best part of the movie, honestly, ends up being a prank by a bunch of kids. (IYKYK)

I hope we are not about to see the Shyamalan effect with Jordan Peele, where the debut film is amazing and everything that follows leaves you scratching your head. I feel like I'm on that road with Peele's body of silver screen work. "Get Out" was a masterpiece, while "Us" jus didn't do it for me and now "Nope!"Keke Palmer did her thing in the role she played (she is the star of this movie for sure) and Daniel kept up with a good performance in his own right, but the film itself was something outta the Twilight Zone. More of a sci-fi thriller than a horror flick, it had too many holes and unanswered questions for my liking. Peele's approach to filmmaking is amazing, much like Shyamalan, but the stories, like Shyamalan's are starting to fall short of being good films.Jordan may have dreamt this story and woke up at 5am and jotted down every detail he could remember. And like our weird dreams, they never make any sense and we forget a lot of the details by the time we wake up! Nope was like one of those weird a... dreams!
46e57#$sw%%62$45@
Saw "Nope" and if I had to grade for individual performances, 5-stars would be for Daniel Kaluuya's performance. He's always at the top of his game, though in this absurd waste of time and energy, he did the best he could with what he had to work with. You can see and feel his emotions through his facial expressions and his eyes, and he really doesn't need to have a line of dialogue. That's talent and he was actually the best thing in this film.Keke Palmer was over the top in "Nope", to the point of where she was sometimes wildly annoying. Palmer needed to tamp it down in a lot of scenes. She was doing WAY too much.Allow me to say that I am firmly on team Jordan Peele. I loved "Get Out", I liked a lot of "Us" (you can never go wrong with Lupita Nyong'o and Winston Duke), but "Nope" is by far the worst film of the three Peele horror films. As a matter of fact, it's a bad film period. I know a lot of people want to get into an esoteric conversation regarding the symbolism in "Nope", save it, that's people attempting to see what's not really there, and to rescue and make excuses for a horribly ill-conceived film.The pacing was slow as HELL, the storylines, and there were many, were unnecessarily complicated and confusing. You may have had a semi-scare a couple of times, but that was it. And let's not even start with the alien spaceship and what it was doing and what it morphed into. Simply put, I'm disappointed in this film and Peele because I know he's capable of better. Yet with "Nope", he rested on his laurels and phoned it in.

Nope had too many subplots between the horses, a brother and a sister, an Asian cowboy, the UFO, and a electronic store employee.The acting and cinematography was great. However the plot felt messy. I don't know if it was a sci-fi, drama, mystery, or something else.Capture the UFO on camera. Okay but they had an issue, the UFO wanted to toy with their electronics. Which makes it difficult to capture.I thought they will be famous. Nope. Their was a boss battle. It was epic but felt short.The UFO looked so weird, I couldn't set my attention on it. I don't know if it was a cowboy hat or a flying Wedding dress.We'll it kept me bored and I couldn't understand what it wanted to be. I wouldn't watch it for a second time.It's a Nope for me.
46e57#$sw%%62$45@
Don't believe the silly IMDB rating, this was not a good movie.The UFO "reveal" is very silly and anti-climactic, and all interest is lost when that occurs. The only reason is gets 4 stars from me is the cinematography of an isolated California ranch, and the night time shots of the lonely ranch are also very well done, with appropriate spookiness and great atmosphere of the setting.Otherwise, a silly and pretentious and non-scary, non-horror movie that will only please those looking for another mediocre "diversity" type movie. There are about a million more being made by Hollywood these days.

The amount of reviews calling this pointless and terrible clearly didn't read much into what happens here. Peele is pointing a mirror up to you and the most ironic part is a lot of don't even seem to notice. No, this isn't a typical horror movie. It's more of a Spielbergian blockbuster satire with some amusing moments sprinkled throughout. The "entity" is creative and can be quite terrifying. The cinematography is top notch and probably the standout feature of the film, while Kaluuya can say an immense amount without even speaking a word. The screenplay is odd to say the least, but it hits more than it misses.While I still think this is a lesser film than Get Out or Us and it ran a little too long, you have to commend its originality in a summer sea of IP-based films. Peele attempts something profound and unique here, which should be respected regardless of your thoughts on the film.
46e57#$sw%%62$45@
Jordan's movies are hit or miss. Get Out was good. US was meh. This was terrible. Go in knowing it'll be hit or miss. This was a miss. Good story idea, horrific execution. The leads were good but the action was meandering. A story needs to have a reason to be told. This one had mo reason. Zero. Next time I will wait until his movies are on HBO MAX.
46e57#$sw%%62$45@
Its not the actors because they are all excellent. I guess its the plot of the movie and how slow it is to start or get going.From the first 10 minutes i thought it would be a good movie but after 30 minutes it went downhill fast and the ending was even worst.
46e57#$sw%%62$45@
LOUSY sci-fi film dealing with aliens abducting people and animals for some reason. With one exception the acting was terrible full of characters you don't give a damn about. The plot goes all over the place including a subplot involving a killer chimpanzee that--as far as I can tell--had NOTHING to do with the rest of the film! It's also slow-moving (there's no reason for this to run over two hours) and quite frankly boring. Also I couldn't make heads or tales out of the explanation given at the end. Only Brandon Perea as Angel makes this movie watchable. When someone asks you to see it respond with the title of the film!

We liked it, rating it a 7.5. I've read many of the poor reviews, and...I don't get it. "Horror" doesn't mean only gory, bloody, slasher films. Suspense is integral to a horror film, and Nope delivers that. No story line? There's something strange going on in their gulch that killed their dad, they're trying to find out what it is - and capitalize on it. Not that hard.SPOILERS"aliens abducting people and animals for some reason" REALLY? Alien was EATING them! How hard is that to figure out?"And where did the flying shrapnel even come from?" SERIOUSLY? The alien was ridding its digestive system of anything inorganic. How hard is that to figure out?"a crazed A/V specialist who sacrifices himself for no reason" REALLY? I guess most people "watch" movies but really don't pay attention. Antlers made some statement about his being the best, and how hard it is to top that. When he saw the creature, he knew his greatest achievement would be to get the perfect shot - of being swallowed up into it. Like storm chasers who would love to film being picked up by a tornado. He knew he could film the innards, and then the alien would spit out the camera and film - thus giving the world a film clip that no one else could ever top."slow moving" and "boring". I'm guessing these are people who have the attention span of a gnat and want something to happen every five seconds. "Slow moving" - it's actually building suspense. Nothing boring about it. Every scene had a purpose.* e.g. Why did Jupe want to buy the ranch? For the sacrificial horses he used every Friday night...(Which is dumb. It'd be far cheaper to buy horses destined for slaughter.)*We had a hard time figuring out the "why" of the Gordy subplot. When I Googled it, now I get the tie-in. Google "what's the deal with Gordy the chimp in nope" to get the Mashable article, which explains it well.We thought the film was beautifully shot, that the pacing was good, we understood the characters (introverted OJ, fame-seeking Emerald), and the plan to capture the alien on film based on everything they'd observed about it - and not die - was fun.My only issues with it were:
#1 - I didn't get the whole Gordy subplot before I Googled it.#2 - I thought it stupid that it wouldn't suck you up if you didn't look at it. I'd missed the point about it "being territorial" so don't challenge it by looking at it. I'm sorry, but in my mind, an alien with that technology can tell what's organic or not. Organic? Suck up and eat. Not organic? Pass.#3 - I was disappointed the alien opened up to the big floaty thing. The concept of it being a hard spaceship on the outside, organic on the inside (like Battlestar Galactica's Cylon Raiders) was much more interesting to me. And blowing up just because it ate one giant balloon...aargh.But we liked it. It was intriguing, it was fun.

Jordan Peele's return to the big screen is a tremendous, refreshing change of pace to the recent Hollywood flops and disappointments the recent MCU films have been.Jordan Peele is in top form with his recent film Nope. I am very pleasantly surprised with how well done this was and how much I enjoyed this film. I had no doubt with Jordan Peele he would do something good but he has set a new bar in the psychological, thriller, horror genre.I don't know where to start as I have so many thoughts racing through my brain, so I'll start simple. Great cinematography this film was beautiful and looked great on the IMAX screen. Great writing and I have to stop to say the writing in this film is superior to the writing in Get Out and Us. Jordan Peele's writing talent has come a long way since those films. The dialogue and chemistry between actors and characters was so organic, it just felt so natural and nothing feeling forced. Speaking of things not feeling forced the comedy and jokes, all do so well and don't detract from the serious tone of the film.Which will lead me to great acting. Daniel Kaluuya, Keke Palmer, Brandon Perea, and Steven Yeun (just to name a few of the films stars) all give tremendous performances. It was so great to see Steven Yeun as I haven't seen him in anything since he starred as Glenn Rhee in The Walking Dead. Amazing sound design and sound effects, it truly brought the tension and horror to tremendous heights it had me on the edge of my sit.Now I want to discuss the viewing experience as it has been a long time since a horror film truly had an impact on me. Some genuinely terrifying moments that like I said had me on the edge of my seat. I am not easily scared and jump scares I find them to be cheap and weak but there were some scares here that genuinely made me jump. At one moment I found myself saying "nope, not today Satan" I'm sure there will be a lot of "nope" remarks from audience members. But is this worth the IMAX screen? To that question I'd say yes and no. This film did not make much use of IMAX cameras which throughout the film made me question why is it in IMAX? But I have to say when the IMAX sequences finally came along it was great. The utilization of the IMAX cameras in certain scenes made for a great pay off and of course coupled with the great IMAX sound it heightened the viewing experience. But I can't say it was a must watch in IMAX. To steer away from spoilers I will simply say a teaser trailer for a certain upcoming film from my favorite director made watching it in IMAX well worth it.I'll start wrapping this up as I'm sure some people who saw the amount of text in this review thought "nope, I'm not reading all that" no pun intended. The only real downside of this film for me was it did lose a little steam in the conclusion and I didn't feel satisfied nor unsatisfied. I still have a lot of questions and would like some more information but perhaps these questions are answered in the film and I missed them. I definitely plan on multiple viewings of this film.This is my new favorite Jordan Peele film, better than his recent film Us and right up there with Get Out while surpassing it. I would rate this film between a 8.5 or 8.9 but because I don't like half scores I'm going to give it the full 9 because of how this film at moments genuinely had me jumping. It was a fun, exciting, thrill ride from start to finish. I look forward to whatever comes next from Jordan Peele.IMDb: 9/10
Letterboxd: 4/5Watched in IMAX Theater.

LIKES:The Comedy At Times: Peele knows how to put comedy into his work and often to maximize the laughs. He does this very well again, using so little to accomplish so much without trying. His skits with Keele showed putting a lot of energy, but for Nope, the comedy is much more controlled, dropped in at the right times to try and offset the tension. Peele manages to put a lot of fun into the writing from the blunt delivery of Kaluuya's lines to the energetic come get some of Palmer's character Em, it just comes off natural and is not too wedged in to get in the way of the movie. It's also sprinkled nicely throughout the movie, and finding the right time to spice up the moment.The Pace Mostly: For a movie that promised to be elevated horror and potentially very deep, the pacing was decent for this writer. Nope starts out the same style of Peele's work, taking lots of time set up the pieces and give you inklings of how everyone will be connected. Then as the events start to happen, he manages to ramp things up and start focusing on uncovering elements, all while still focusing on that character development. It's the intrigue that pulled me in, trying to see what the next the level to the story was all while trying to discover the twist he had in store. The pace continued to be like that for much of the film, until right about the end where things changed, but for about 75% of the movie, the pace was thrilling for this horror movie.The Twist: Peele has always found a way to put his shocking imagination to the works and really keep you guessing as to what the spin to the story will be. Once again, he does not fail to deliver, bringing with it elevated levels of viewing the world and clever symbolism to show the state of the world. His use famous verses and quotes, mixed with subtle signs and visual aids, all work to be that level of poetic disposition he does so well, allowing one to interpret the message to their liking. And yet, for those who just want straight gimmicks and entertainment, Peele is there to give you an odd change to formula that may or may not be impressive to you. For me, he again uses it well and gives the science fiction genre a nice refresh that has plenty to offer the horror element, some shots he used very well to display it. That thrill part really makes the story take a new element and the way he integrates in the odd manner at the end.The Horror Elements/Tension: Now we are getting to the stuff most care about for the genre, and in this film the horror elements are certainly creative and well done at times. Nope works on several levels to give you the chills experience, starting with the odd and offset, where just enough hints are given to bait you, but have not given everything away. They then start adding tension to the mix, using elements to build up the moment with use of shadows, the feeling of abandonment and the use of shadows. Soon, crazy things start getting immersed into the movie, and the sickening elements bleed in, nods to the classic horror movies, as the disturbing visuals get their moment creep you out. Finally, the tension at the end as the whole finale hits, gives you that intensity to help maintain the edge, but drops the horror element for something else. Again, there is a wicked nature to the whole thing that darker beings will love to watch.The Acting: You've heard it from many, but no surprise, Nope has an A game of cast to bring this movie to life. Once more, all the cast hits their shining moment and brings that intricacy that the film needs to make sure it comes off creepy. For the big three though we have a few more words to say. Perea is the guy who is the blend of both characters, the sort of comedic support a film needs to help offset the horror. He's a fun character to dive into and certainly makes for an entertaining lead with plenty of jokes to throw into the fire. However, the two leads are the brother and sister duo of OJ and Em, and the group who portray them. Palmer is energetic, bringing sass and fire that is trying to bring the ranch to modern times and challenge the threat at hand. She's the visionary of the group, and her energy livens up the rather serious tone without shattering the believability or elements of the story. It really works and she executes it so well that you can't help but get pulled into all the traits she brings. As for Kaluuya, he transitions well into the modern cowboy roles and I was very impressed with how much he was able to do with so few words spoken. There is just something in his performance and mannerisms that works so well, and I was very happy to see how Peele used his talents to really make the simplistic character layered in comedy, story, and just plain laughs.The Cinematography: By far, my favorite was the cinematography and the sound that went with it. Nope is all about the right shot to get the moment perfectly terrifying and Peele's team did it beautifully in bringing the odd encounter to life. Shadows as mentioned earlier are deceptive and haunting, leaving you feeling isolated, but yet watched. The angles of the saucer attack grip you into the experience and find a way to make the whole ordeal as gruesome and terrifying as you expect. Even the emotional moments has all the right direction to them and I felt the presence of every moment in the presentation they brought us. Thrown in great sound elements to back it up, or lack of it some cases, and Nope's technical aspect achieves great thing for this reviewer to make it worthwhile to visit in theaters.DISLIKES:Plot Holes/Underused Elements: I agree with other reviewers that Peele's plot seemed a little less put together as some of his other works. Nope holds a lot of elements to it, but in terms of complete character story, full on challenges, and even answers to some brimming questions the movie does not quite wrap things up as neatly as he does. The random film element tie in for one character is certainly interesting, but is this awkward tangent that is more a symbolic poke at something and could have been left out. A legendary camera man seems to have a lot prowess and logic, but then things happen to counter that, subtle hints being seen that don't quite make sense and seem a bit hurried. Even Angel's background is sort of like a stoner secondary character that would have been nice to flesh out. All in all, these elements are present enough to get you thinking and serve as the sword slash to modern day culture, but don't quite fit as nicely together like other parts of his movies.Cross the Line a Little On One my elements: I can't really say much without ruining a twist, but there is a bit of animal cruelty in this movie that is not my particular taste. As human as many productions are, there are some portrayals that I'm just not a fan of watching and Peele sometimes cross the line for me. I have to give him props for keeping it relevant, but there were other moments I would have preferred not to see.A Few Random Elements That Seemed Jammed In: This has to do with the ending where a lot of things happen very quickly in the climactic finale. Particularly the introduction of a random character whose name holds the symbolic nature, the smoothness of the final moment is mediocre for this reviewer. These elements may have held more shine in the poke fun at modern times role, however story wise seemed out of place and less useful than just adding more to the other characters we were already invested in. Sure, Peele does have some set up to help out and throw real world logic into it, but it just did not seem useful given what was about to happen.The Pacing: As mentioned, the pace is definitely interesting for about 70-75% of the film, but that other part is a little up and down for me. Watching it unfold at times, the movie drags a bit, going down this element that is supposed to mean something big, but again barely fits into the ordeal they are crafting. Meanwhile, the ending seems very rushed, with things happening that just don't make sense nor have the tie ups I like to see in his work. There are "changes" that happen to the characters, but they are so sudden with only tidbits of dialogue to support them that you wonder a bit more why they did what they did. Watching breakdowns from the artistic point works, but as for story elements it's a bit disappointing for the average viewer.The Verdict:Nope is a movie with an interesting name, and like most of Peele's work an interesting premise for both artistic sakes and horror sakes. He finds a way to merge the three worlds of mystery, horror, and sci-fi into this layered film, that is pretentious, but still holds entertaining elements that we like to see. Great acting, a deep story, horror elements that take advantage of so many things, alongside supreme visuals are the keys to what makes this movie hold a lot of bite. It's weird, it's convoluted, and yet it works if you can get onboard with his trippy thriller work from the past. However, the movie is not my favorite of the bunch and does not quite get the smoothness that I've seen in the past of this film. It's rushed at times, boring at others, with a story element running tangent that does not quite mesh as well as other origin elements of previous works. Still, it's a fun movie with a few moments worth rewatching, and for those enjoying symbolic takes of the times, worth even more views to dissect all Peele has crammed into the film. Definitely worth a trip to the movies for this one, and I encourage you to take a moment and view it where you can.My scores are:Horror/Mystery/Sci-Fi: 8.0
Movie Overall: 7.0.

Greetings again from the darkness. With his first two films, GET OUT (2017) and US (2019), writer-director-producer Jordan Peele already has an Oscar and has firmly established himself as one of the most innovative and visionary filmmakers working today. He has entered the revered class of directors whose new films are automatically 'must see'. This is in spite of our knowing full well that he doesn't strive for mass accessibility, and typically seems less focused on character development and more focused on what's happening to those characters and how they react. Mr. Peele's latest is a unique blend of Science Fiction, Horror, and Comedy, with a dose of horses, UFOs, and box store employees. At its core, the film is about chasing the spectacle of a spectacle, so that one might become a spectacle themself.A cold opening is a bit of 'found footage' from a horrific event on the set of a TV show featuring a chimp named Gordy. We have no idea how this fits in to what we are about to watch, but it's shocking and disturbing. We then shift to find Otis Haywood Sr (Keith David) working the horses on a ranch with his son, OJ Jr (Oscar winner Daniel Kaluuya, JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH, 2021). Dad founded the Haywood Hollywood Ranch to train and handle horses for the entertainment industry - movies, TV shows, advertisements. A mysterious death means OJ Jr and his sister Emerald (Keke Palmer, AKEELAH AND THE BEE, 2006) must take over running the ranch; however, a hilarious scene on set highlights the differences between big brother and little sister. OJ understands horses, but is laconic and reserved. Emerald is hungry for personal fame and is bursting with energy and dreams. She has little use for the ranch, while OJ is devoted to carrying on dad's work - knowing he needs Emerald's personality.The suspense is turned up to 11 when strange things begin happening on the ranch and in the sky. OJ (his name is a running gag) and Emerald recognize this is their opportunity to cash in by securing photographic evidence of UFO (or UAP) and alien activity. Joining in on the mission is Angel (a terrific Brandon Perea), a tech nerd from Fry's Electronics. The trio is joined later by renowned cinematographer Antlers Holst (Michael Wincott using a Tom Waits voice), who understands the importance of capturing what OJ and Emerald call "the Oprah shot". Obviously, this is Peele's commentary on how folks today long for their chance to shine in the spotlight - and capitalize monetarily on the moment. Also recognizing this shot at fame is Ricky "Jupe" Park (Steven Yeun), the owner of a local western-themed amusement park. Jupe is a former child actor whose career included "Kid Sheriff" and a role in the sitcom featured in the opening sequence with Gordy the chimp. He has tapped into the skyward activities, but longs for more.Purposefully vague is my approach in writing about this, as director Peele and cinematographer extraordinaire, Hoyte Van Hoytema (frequent collaborator with Christopher Nolan) serve up some incredible visuals and high-suspense sequences, and it's best if you know as little as possible going in. It's easy to spot influences of CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND (1977), "The Twilight Zone", and other Sci-Fi classics, as well as directors Steven Spielberg and Alfred Hitchcock. In a tip of the cap to film history, Peele ties in the early moving picture work of Eadweard Muybridge and his 1878 clip, "The Horse in Motion." It's a brilliant touch that cinephiles will appreciate.Supporting work comes from Donna Mills, Oz Perkins, Eddie Jemison, and Terry Notary as Gordy the Chimp, but it's the chemistry between Kaluuya and Palmer that make a relatively thin story succeed as commentary on society. Peele even gets in a few pot shots at the media (TMZ) and the oversaturation of celebrity. The desolate setting of the hills and valleys outside of Los Angeles make for a perfect setting, as does the contrasting use of daytime and nighttime for certain shots. Peele proves yet again that he has a real feel for serving up commentary disguised as tension, or is it tension doused with commentary? Either way, I'm lining up now for his next film, whatever that may be.Opening in theaters July 22, 2022.

I am really disappointed in this film. Poor premise, poor character motivation, and beyond unrealistic character behaviors. Basically, a alien predator/shark is preying on extremely low populated area. Additionally characters get away but have the bright idea of risking there lives to challenge and capture the alien on film (as if anyone would still believe them) for money( come on). With the resources at Jordan's disposal I expected him to produce a much higher quality of movies. This one missed the mark entirely.

What a horrible mess. It honestly felt like Jordan Peele just took notes on random events in his life, some from reality and others from dreams and decided to string them together on a movie script.There were some bone chilling scenes and great use of cinematography. I'll give it a few stars for that but ultimately there are way too many flaws. Characters actions rarely made sense, weighed down with incoherent and flat out weird dialog. Covid social distancing was way too obvious, and ultimately the story telling was extremely boring.This really makes you wonder, Jordan Peele's Get Out was brilliant! How do you go from that to this in just a few years? I mean one could watch Get Out over and over yet no one would ever sit through this twice even if they were paid.
46e57#$sw%%62$45@
"Nope" was enthralling. I see it as a social commentary on people stunting and doing wild stuff for social media clout. I still prefer Peele's first film "Get Out", and I haven't seen "Us" but I'm probably gonna check it out now.I also see a lot of it as a smart twist on the horror genre. Whereas a lot of filmmakers create horror movies where the main characters survive despite their stupidity, this one plays on the main characters actually being clever enough to "nope out." Finally, our years of yelling "don't go in the closet/basement/outside, you idiot!" at the movie screen have been answered.Keke Palmer and Daniel Kaluuya are terrific as the stars. The cinematography is on point. This whole movie is beautifully shot with a lot of subplots and recurring themes that will leave a lot of room for interpretation and after-movie discussion.Definitely one of the best of 2022 so far. It drags just a bit in the middle but I found it very fun and interesting.

Major swing and a miss. The pacing is so-o-o-o slow and there is zero story. If you can see this for free, fine. But do not pay your hard-earned money to see this. Not worth it.
46e57#$sw%%62$45@
I gave into the hype to go watch this on the big screen -- big mistake. This is one of the worst movies I've watched in a long time. There's no continuity, no story, no character growth, nothing. They foreshadow things that they never follow up on. Characters do things that are completely unexplainable. I cannot recommend this to anyone. Avoid.

Thor: Love and Thunder does attempt to explore themes of love and loss whilst introducing the Mighty Thor and putting Thor on a journey of self discovery. However, it sadly doesn't work as well as it should due to a rushed pace and way too many jokes that are almost never funny.Chris Hemsworth is still going strong as Thor but the extreme goofiness is getting a little stale. Natalie Portman has never been better as this character and Tessa Thompson is still great as Valkyrie, even though she doesn't really get much to do.Taika Waititi massively overstays his welcome as Korg this time, who becomes very annoying really fast. Christian Bale is one of the better MCU villains with a good motivation and an unsettling presence but is let down by limited screen time.Takia's direction on the other hand is stronger, there's some nice visual imagery and the colour palette is pretty vibrant but the MCU grey is still present throughout sadly. The CG is consistently inconsistent from start to finish.The music by Michael Giacchino is fine, there's one new theme that's pretty memorable but the lack of Thor's theme is annoying. The soundtrack is really good, all the songs are classics that fit the tone and style well but some could have been used better.
46e57#$sw%%62$45@
Christian Bale is great, Russell Crowe has a good moment, Hemsworth is good but this movie cannot be saved from a terrible script, bad direction and stupid humour that overstays its welcome.

Fine seems to cover it, Disney has become fine, everything is fine. It has got to the point where if spending your time aimlessly going through your phone for 2+ hours or watching a marvel movie is a bigger waste of time.

...Well, maybe not SNL-esque throughout the full length of the movie, but most of the film was a (poorly delivered) "comedy."During the first scene, I wondered if I was in the right theater, because it had more of a serious tone than many of the other Marvel movies. Unfortunately, shortly after Gorr encountered his god, the seriousness tone disintegrated immediately and the movie launched into full ludicrous mode.I rolled my eyes too often. The "jokes" came zooming by too often. Guns &amp; Roses music was used too often. The goats screamed (way) too often.There's too much that should have been shown, but occurred off screen. (Gorr killing various gods, for example). I often wanted more from the movie and also wanted the movie to end quickly at the same time.At one point, I thought..."I wish I was more tired, so I could take a short nap during this movie." That's not good.I like Taika Waititi, but he needed to switch to decaf on this project. He turned the knob past 11 to 374, (Take that Spinal Tap).This movie was silly and stupid throughout the majority of its run time. Maybe watch this on TV when nothing else is on.

I'm a huge marvel fanboy, and hardly ever have anything bad to say to about the MCU, but this was a huge letdown. Ragnarok is easily one of my top 5 marvel films , so was very excited to see this one, but this was really really bad. It was boring as hell and none of the jokes landed for me. First time in a marvel movie I really wanted to leave or wished it would end already. Huge waste of Gorr the god butcher. And the whole Zeus and Olympus part were so cringe worthy. I don't know how this got made. It was garbage.
46e57#$sw%%62$45@
First off let's start by asking what gods Gorr the GOD BUTCHER actually butchered? Some off screen, one he killed that was far from butchering at the beginning of the movie, apparently cut off Sif's arm but at no point did he seem like this absolutely terrifying villain he should have been. Thor, Valkyrie and Jane never seemed afraid of him in the least. In fact, in the times they were captured they were never hurt, Thor just kept making wise cracks and in the battles Gorr never seemed to have an upper hand other than wounding Valkyrie who was apparently never even close to death. Christian Bale played the character wonderfully but the script was just bad.Now for the humor. There's so much of it that it isn't even humorous anymore. In fact, after the 4th joke in 60 seconds I found myself just going "can we get on with the movie?". Many of the jokes fell flat to the point I only heard a handful of people laughing now and then in the movie theater. The "serious" moments are interrupted by more joking. Jane telling Thor she has cancer has to be a serious moment right? Cut to Valkyrie and Korg making jokes and singing in the other room. Jane receiving chemo? Nope, "funny" moment of her tearing apart her own book to explain wormholes to another guy in the office. The screaming goats were funny the first time they screamed then it just got annoying.Why were the Guardians of the Galaxy in this movie? Starlord looked like a hobo and everyone else was just screaming to the point that it gave me a headache and then of course they brought the goats in.Nobody dies or comes close to dying to a villain in this movie and perhaps that's one of many reasons it wasn't enjoyable. None of the villains have seemed like villains in phase 4. Gorr was redeemed at the end after being beaten. Jane dies of cancer which was expected but then goes to Valhalla in the end credit scene so nothing seems "final".Thor steals Zeus' thunderbolt and ends up giving the power of Thor to kids in the movie temporarily...but he whispers it to the Thunderbolt so shouldn't it have been the power of Zeus? This was just one of so many plotholes in this movie. Eternity can grant any wish but uh....why didn't they use that to bring back those erased in the snap or Natasha.The best part of this movie was Thor arguing with Stormbreaker because of him being jealous of Mjolnir. They finally make up after Thor "gives him a beer" but then at the end of the movie he gives it to Gorr's resurrected daughter. It's just a small little arc there that went nowhere.Overall this movie was horrible. They tried to take Ragnarok's mix of humor and serious moments but ramped the humor up to 11 and it failed. The end says Thor will return and I hope he does, just with a different script writer and director.

I think most people thought it was a big mistake when Disney cut ties with Lord &amp; Miller before they completed their Solo film. Now I'm not so sure. It's a little off-putting having a downright farcical movie in an established cinematic universe. Thor: Love and Thunder is about as grounded as a Naked Gun movie, but for some reason the comedy rarely hits for me, where I can enjoy it in an actual spoof. I was surprised, despite the nearly constant attempts at humor, the crowded theater I was in rarely did more than chuckle. If they're going to make a straight-up comedy then they need it to be more laugh-out-loud funny. Of course comedic taste is extremely subjective, so I'm sure some people enjoy laughing along. I just wish it was as effective as Taika Waititi's other films have been for me (including Thor Ragnarok.)The real problem with Thor: Love and Thunder is that it is so irreverent but they also try to tackle heavier topics. The film starts with the death of a child, it focuses on a major character dealing with cancer, and the villain is literally called "the god butcher." Going back to my comparison to The Naked Gun, it's like you are watching that film and the filmmakers expect you to feel bad about Nordberg almost getting killed. There is no weight to anything, and it undercuts any attempt at emotion. I'd be genuinely shocked if someone told me they shed a tear while watching this movie, even if the humor lets up at the big climactic moment, though it clearly is trying for some real heart-tugging. I can take a light-hearted movie in the MCU where nothing of vital importance happens, but there are some important plot points, and that's a problem.That's not the only problem with Thor: Love and Thunder, and I could probably go on a full tirade about many of the other issues. However, I will restrain myself and just hit each one like quick bullet points. The handing off of Mjolnir like a loyal pet kind of undermines the magic of the whole "worthy" thing established prior to this film. The quick shuffling off of the Guardians of the Galaxy is about as shoddy as Chris Pratt's hair in the film. The whole god convention sequence is atrocious and makes you feel like Gorr has the right idea. Thor has become as shallow and dumb as the version they featured on the What If show. The handing off of Thor's lightning powers to anyone at any time with any weapon makes him look rather selfish in prior films when they could have used a bit of extra help against someone like Thanos. The deus ex machina of the Eternity wish now makes previous plans of people like Thanos and even the Scarlet Witch feel over-complicated when all they needed was a quick trip with Stormbreaker. I'll stop there, but the really sad thing about all this is that it has taken less than 3 years for the MCU to go from a franchise where I couldn't bear to miss a single film, to a franchise where I might just skip out on some movies because the quality has dipped so dramatically.

Movie is okay. Christian Bale is awesome, Chris still can't act, but we never liked him for his talent, rest of the cast brings what they have to the whole movie is an average Disney factory work, everyone knows their job and they execute is as they should. The story has too many silly jokes. I know Waititi's style, but now he feels like his own parody. Like those Scream parody Scary Movies.
46e57#$sw%%62$45@
Ok, so maybe that is an exaggeration, but you have to search long and hard to find another moment in American film history when two mega-blockbusters of such extreme stupidity were released back to back.Ragnarok was funny to some degree, but that was mostly due to how unexpected its gonzo humor was. (Plus, Ragnarok at least had a decent Tom Hiddleston performance before everyone got sick of him on Disney Plus). Love and Thunder just dials everything up to a degree that it just becomes swamped and strained instead. Again, it falls into the same pitfall of Ragnarok: since it's an M'C'U film it can't exclusively focus on comedy and tries to make you take it seriously at some points. (Or even worse, deals with serious topics and expects you to laugh at the same time). I feel like there is place for a stupid heavy-metal mythological space viking movie, but this is too bogged down in franchise mire to be a worthwhile one.Oh, well. My expectations were low to begin with. Taika Waititi has essentially sold his soul to corporate Disney money-grubbers at this point and I think Jojo Rabbit may be the last unique film we see from him. (Does anybody really want to see his upcoming Star Wars film?). Add that to the fact that we entered an age of overperforming, original/innovative films (Top Gun, Elvis, EEAAO) and Thor seems more and more like a relic of a bygone past when people only cared about CGI gloop. Hopefully the times are changing, but you never know.

There are so many things wrong with this film, I'm not sure where to start. Bale was good, and Helmsworth did what he could with what he was given, but the script was just so bad.The screaming goats joke went on way too long. Thor's costume looked ridiculous. Valkyrie being made King, when she's a girl. I guess Queen wasn't good enough? Enough with the rock guy Korg. Korg also tells us a nice little story about how his dad met his other dad (sigh).Somehow Natalie getting cancer makes her worthy of mjolnir. Thor can now turn other people (including kids here) into other "Thors" (when did this happen?). Plus, Thor is a person, not a title to be bestowed onto others.Then a scene where Zeus removes Thor's clothes and has him naked in a great hall area filled with people. If this had been one of the women characters there would have been backlash. Thor was deconstructed in this movie basically becoming an idiot with powers, not The God of Thunder that he once was. Jane Thor has to save Thor obviously.I could go on, by why bother. You can see what they did here. Since Disney Phase 4, they have put out only crap (except maybe Mandolorian). They destroyed Star Wars, and now they killed the MCU. Impressive.

Every million Thor: Love and Thunder makes, is a million Marvel Studios and Disney has stolen, in the true meaning of the word, from fans. And believe me when I say that this farce of a movie is so vacant, that there really is nothing to spoil."Gorr - The God Butcher", yet not once did we see him butcher anyone, let alone a god, apart from a lousy stab. In any other franchise, such a gross disservice would have sparked outrage or contempt, but because it is the MCU, anything goes. That together with an endless barrage of bad and recycled jokes and plot issues the director couldn't have been bothered with, Thor: Love and Thunder, which is essentially named after Chris and his daughter, is a box of candy only good for causing a visual sugar high, only without the high or the sweetness. The MCU is no longer a loved franchise, it has become a worshiped one, which is why it can get away with producing thoughtless and empty products, and yet still be praised and consumed with gratitude.This movie only served to stroke Chris Hemsworth and Taika Waititi's egos, while being a platform to showcase their children. And please don't interpret this as me "bashing" their children, they are completely innocent in this; it's their parents' egomania at fault. Thor: Love and Thunder has no substance, direction, or purpose, and is just a project of pure nepotism and ego.This movie is half-baked, senseless, and intentionally ridiculous, which emphasizes just what a vanity venture it is.I read somewhere someone say:Avengers: Endgame: "Whatever it Takes".Thor: Love and Thunder: "Whatever".This is perhaps the most apt description of this thing that is a movie only by name.In the sentiments of Chris Hemsworth and Taika Waititi, they suggest that this is a movie a 7-year-old would've made, and that the focus was 6-year-olds, showing how Marvel is now even flaunting its arrogance and disregard without shame.Thor: Love and Thunder is not a movie, nor is it a movie for Marvel/MCU fans, it is a scam, a con, and footage of the Waititi and Hemsworth's family get-togethers, for them to enjoy during the holidays, but not us, together as families, and Taika and Chris are the con artists, which is about as much art as they display.I'm not mad, disappointed, or surprised by this wreck of a movie, I'm merely aware of what the MCU is, or has become, and as an MCU fan, I'm just accepting of how the mighty have indeed fallen, at least from a quality point of view.If you had asked me years ago if I thought I'd ever give an MCU movie such a low rating, I probably would've laughed in your face, and yet, here we are:3/10.

The film fails to meet the expectations of a great sequel. The Director is over reliant on unnecessary and childish humor. Christian Bale's character is underdeveloped for the most part. Zeus is a forgettable character in the movie. Thor does bring some fun to the movie but it does not help the film recover at any point. I would not rush to the Theaters for this sequel. O what a missed opportunity 👎.
46e57#$sw%%62$45@
I can't be bothered typing an essay so I'll sum up:Thor is reduced to a bumbling idiot to elevate Jane and Valkyrie.Horrible CGI.Jokes that don't land.A plot not worth caring about.Forgettable set pieces.Overuse of Guns N Roses.

This review will come off as very negative, but I had a decent time, laughed a lot, and was fairly entertained. As a big-time MCU fan though, Love and Thunder is highly disappointing, even more so for an OG Avenger.For reference, I loved all of the previous Thor movies. Many people view the first two as bottom tier MCU but I think they're beastly and beautiful in a Shakespearian way, while also being funny and visually stunning. Then they went in a new direction with Ragnarok, and I was completely on board. I enjoyed the infusion of style and almost all of the humor works.Love and Thunder goes so far past Ragnarok in every way. So much of it doesn't work for me. So much of the humor is predictable and goofy, to the point of bordering on cartoonish. And there isn't nearly enough serious to balance out the comedy. Combine that with some odd decisions later in the movie and... it kind of feels like they're turning Thor into a joke.And don't get me started on a repeated joke involving two goats that made me think of Jar Jar. I didn't laugh the first time or the 20 times after.Other than the comedy, a lot of Love and Thunder doesn't feel fully natural. Something feels off. The action scenes aren't memorable. By comparison, Ragnarok has multiple action scenes that make my jaw drop. There are some beautiful shots, but not nearly as often as the artwork in the previous ones.But my biggest disappointment is the villain. I don't watch trailers and didn't know Christian Bale is in this movie. He is my favorite actor ever, and has been for the last 15 years. Even with all the amazing talent in this remarkable MCU cast list, IMO Bale stands out above them all. I was ecstatic...Until I realized he's barely in the movie. He gives a great performance, but the script does not flesh him out, does not explore his character, and in effect, turns him into another forgettable MCU villain. Wasting Bale like this is a horrendous decision...Especially after an amazing opening scene that made me think this movie might be on a different level. I can only imagine what could have been if 40% of the movie was dedicated to that character. I can only imagine how amazing it would have been if they treated the God Butcher like The Dark Knight treated Joker.Why couldn't they balance out the serious and the funny? A good example: Guardians 2 is so funny and can get pretty goofy, but it has tons of serious and emotionally powerful scenes. Another example: Deadpool 2 is primarily a comedy but has SO many emotional moments, some to the point of tears.IMO, Love and Thunder doesn't come close to the last two MCU movies (Multiverse of Madness and No Way Home). As it stands today, this is bottom 3 in the MCU for me.EDIT: I decided to give this another shot. Sometimes it's easier the second time without the hype and knowing what to expect. But I felt pretty much the same. I enjoyed a lot of it, but the stuff I disliked bothered me just as much.The two things that stood out to me the second time around, Bale's performance is amazing and they are idiots for underutilizing him. And the goats are the single worst thing in the entire MCU. Changing rating from 6 to 5 stars. (2 viewings, opening Thursday IMAX 7/7/2022, IMAX 7/20/2022)

Marvel films have never been for a smart audience. But turning a character like Thor and many others into a Clash Of The Titans rom-com really seals the fate of this incarnation of the MCU. There really is nothing new here save for Thors butt, which nobody ever asked for. But serves to show just how low Marvel will go for toilet humor.

This just another Disney Marvel film. All it is bad jokes and even worse directing. Now we have girl Thor that's not even an asgardian. The film doesn't take its self serious enough, was in a packed theater and most the jokes didn't land. I felt like why is the audience so quiet? Don't waist your money or time on this take the kids to Minions.

Everything is a joke, even when it shouldn't be, leaves the movie itself as "a joke" itself.It has too much of that rock guy Korg. A fan edit removing most of Korg will increase the rating by at least a point.Thor gets the stereotypical Homer Simpson treatment. This is apparently the god of thunder. Ugh.

I feel like I've just watched a movie written by a bunch of school kids. They threw everything funny they could think of against the board and literally forgot everything else that makes a good movie. As a result nothing else in this movie means anything...it's a green screen completely detached from reality...
46e57#$sw%%62$45@
..and yet, this is all so very familiar.Lots of silly jokes (the goats get old really fast), an average villain plot, and no real stakes at any point. Add the fact that beings die (cheaply) and some just don't (a lot), then powerful Gods that become inconsistently useless for the sake of plot. I'm tired of mediocrity. No amount of colorful scenes will make this work, waititi. The worst part is that it uses stories that were written with buildup, intent and merit for a Comic.. and it feels like they were mushed and summarized onto an average script for the sake of substance. That is not to say Chris and Natalie didn't deliver on the emotional tones! It was the part I enjoyed the most.. But it feels ultimately hollow and unimportant.It's a decent watch, in the same vein as the first Ant-Man. The masses might like it (although the theater I went to was mostly silent).You can see naked Thor in the trailer.. so, just wait for the Disney+ release.

The script is hollow and empty. The characters are weak and meaningless. Yes, the special effects are cool, but they can't carry the weight of an entire movie. Marvel will keep modifying Thor in to an idiot, to sell extra tickets. They have done harm an actual religion. If they would have done something similar to Jesus, the Christians would be screaming bloody murder in the streets, boycotting all Marvel related stuff.This movie is insulting to the idea of Norse mythology, in fact, all Thor movies are an insult. Thor is now a diluted merchandizing nightmare which has been stripped of his masculinity. The idea of Thor is lost.They have discarded his belt, and his gloves, and his chariot pulled by two goats, in favor for selling massive hammers of plastic and discarded his Godhood. The hammer has become a sorting hat, with a mind of its own, which is nothing like the mythological hammer for Thor. Facepalm.I did not like this movie.

I never wrote negative review, but now it deserves it. I didn't give doctor strange 2 negative review as that was more worst than this, just for a hope Thor 4 will be good. But as doctor strange Thor character also destroyed.First, I have no problem with women empowerment, I support as well if it has good writing and character development. But I have problem with destruction of male characters. Marvel suddenly forgot story and character development. As a Marvel fan it is so disappointing for me.I have not that problem if MCU didn't follow comics, I always like to be open, want to give a chance the new story, but this time, they added GOR , THE GOD BUTHER! And what he does, become spider and kidnap children, wtf! Seriously! You guys don't have any story for this character showcase! But Bale did excellent acting. But they made GOR typing gray villain.Now coming to Jane, I really liked her, I was excited to see her as mighty thor. But there's no explanation how she become mighty thor, so many loopholes. And I thought she vanished in blip. No typical story as Thor isn't given her time, so they broke up, that's it!Now coming to one of my favourite Thor. The first superhero who got his own 4th movie, just to ruin his character arc. They made him joker, a typical failure guy just like doc strange. He is a god , he lost all of his family, and what he do, COMEDY, cracking jokes all time. I never thought comedy will be insufferable in MCU. Thor was made to be a king, he should be better than Odin! He should rule the Asgard! But now what he do? And why in end game Thor and GOTG team up? GOTG is just a filler in the movie. Oh no the whole movie is the filler.Sorry but mcu isn't same anymore. First they destroyed doc strange, now Thor. Enough.

String of jokes and gags. Bland fight sequences. Hollow characters. Candypop colours and bling. Lazy, formulaic BGM. Pointless, absolutely unnecessary. When did Marvel become a spoof of its own material? Even The Powerpuff Girls had more sincerity than Love and Thunder. Waited for two hours to feel SOMETHING. All I felt was a headache and a pair of tired eyes.

I am at a loss for words, it is childish but not even that. It is actually hard to put this to words.IIt is as if they wanted to try and make this a Comedy but did not even know how to make a Comedy. You know those episodes of your favorite TV shows that they tried to make a musical episode and how cringe it was to watch... Well that is the best way I can describe this.Save your money up for Gas and Groceries and hope Avatar is as good as we all hope.

Maybe I did hype myself too much but since it is coming from Ragnarok and Taika Waititi, I have high expectation for this movie.Chris Hemworth is great to look at. That flick scene was definitely worth it but in the end, the lack of good story and the 'heart' made this movie feel empty.It was a waste of Christian Bale too. The motivation ended up ridiculous. Like why as a God hater, he would actually asked another God being for help. I really thought his first wish was to bring his daughter, but it wasn't so. He had the idea after Thor inspired him.It was an entertaining movie. I did not mind Mighty Thor. Good introduction and Natalie Portman looked great but everything just felt hollow.Some of the humour needed to be tone down too and felt inappropriate for some of the scene. The guardians was barely in it, even for a final battle... is it to prep for their own movie? Who knows...In the end, was I entertained? Yes... Did I wish the movie has more heart in it? Definitely a yes.Phase four basically fizzling out for me.

Wow as a HUGE! Marvel fan I'm shocked at how bad this was. So many cliché jokes, no character development, and Chris Hemsworth is no longer an actor in my opinion but a Disney prop just generating revenue with the same old schtick. I personally think Disney buys reviews because how these disasters just debut with higher rating and falter when us fans speak our mind is shocking. Only good thing was I was able to go see Back Phone after 80 mins of this crap and actually found a movie I really enjoyed that I normally wouldn't have seen. Way better filmmaking and acting. The jokes in this Thor aren't even funny, it's like they try to get the audience to laugh with them but we end up laughing at them. Films don't care about good storytelling anymore, they want to be "politically correct" and enlighten us with how they want us to think. All hogwash. Save your money. Disney is 3rd rate.

Confession: I'm the guy who watched the original Predator way too many times thanks to the magic of VHS...but then never watched a single sequel afterwards. As far as I'm concerned "Predator" = jungles and body butter. So I fully admit that I have limited context here. That said, this movie kicked butt. I cared way more about Naru and her brother (not to mention her dog) than I did about anybody in the original. I found the cinematagrophy breathtaking, I found the characters compelling, and I'm kind of all in on seeing what happens when we transport modern franchises into different historical/cultural contexts. Plus, the callbacks were delightful. Nobody's going to give this movie an Oscar, but I'd rather watch a story like this than most movies with capes and poorly staged action sequences. I was sucked in from moment one, and Amber Midthunder completely captivated me for the whole runtime. It's nice to know that movies like this can still surprise me, not to mention make me stand up and cheer.
46e57#$sw%%62$45@
I didn't hate this movie but I thought the writing was very sloppy, considering the fantastic premise offered so much potential. Sorry if I start to ramble, but it really bugs me when I believe a film could have been greatly improved with a few tweaks of the script. So my problems are as follows (please hear me out - and excuse such a terribly long review, but I just can't help myself, lol):Why is Naru 150% convinced right from the first tiny hint at the predator that there's this HUUGE threat out there? As far as she knows, the predator hasn't hurt anyone except for a snake, and when Naru finds a weird footprint and sees the unnatural, purple lightning/light flashes just before she falls when the mountain lion attacks - how are those things indicative of a bigger threat than the metal trap her dog gets caught in at the beginning? And why does she even think the mysterious purple flashes and the footprint come from a creature of flesh and blood? The only thing she could possibly conceive of (remember: this is a Native American Girl from 300 years ago) is some forest spirit or even some kind of God that has come to these woods - certainly not a creature that any normal Native American would ever intend to hunt (on the contrary, such a creature would more likely be respected or even worshiped).What I'm trying to say is: the predator at this point hasn't done anything that would require any action from Naru (or anyone else), and it's only the audience who knows from previous movies that this creature is a threat - there's no way our heroine would logically deduct that from the evidence she has. The trap her dog got caught in at the beginning on the other hand IS a sign for a huge threat to the tribe, but she doesn't even think it's necessary to warn her people about it, let alone further investigate who/what put it there. I think the script does the character of Naru a huge disservice by making her look rather over-ambitious to prove herself instead of actually giving her a plausible reason for wanting to protect her village by going after the predator.If on the other hand the script had made the stakes more personal (and more primal), it would have worked to the character's and the story's advantage in my opinion. For example: imagine a scenario where they went after the lion, and her brother defeated it - then out of nowhere comes this monster and kills her brother and Naru's the only one who saw it and nobody believes her - then she'd have a believable motivation to go after it. But strange lights and a footprint? Really? That doesn't seem in line with anything we know about Native Americans from that period - it's just the script that insists this makes sense.And Naru's actions towards the bear are another good example of the writing not doing a very good job at showing her as either a skilled hunter or someone who "only wants to protect her people from a threat". Naru is portrayed as this child of nature that knows every plant and every animal track, so when she hears a bear, we must assume she knows it's a bear - yet she goes straight towards it. Why? The bear's not a threat towards anyone, and we learn it's peacefully eating its meal - a scene that shouldn't come as a surprise to a Naru in any way.But she observes it as if she were witnessing something exceptional or new to her. And does she quickly retreat when the bear gets her scent? No, she tries to shoot at it with a bow and arrow! Why would she do that? Is that the action of an intelligent hunter or someone who wants to protect her people? And when that (literally) backfires and gives her position away, and she only gets saved by the dog distracting the bear, she even runs after this gigantic grizzly and tries again to shoot at it with her bow and arrow (and don't tell me she tries to save her dog, because that dog is perfectly able to outrun the bear, as is made very obvious in that scene). The script makes her behave in a way no Native American ever would, and I think the writers should have tried a little harder to portray that culture in a more realistic (and thus more respectful) way.Because here again Naru comes mainly across as someone who's over-eager to prove herself in a one-on-one combat with a dangerous adversary. Her actions seem inept and reckless, and the script makes that even worse since the young men sent out by Naru's brother to rescue her all get killed.And here comes another thing that irked me: all the young Native Americans except for Naru's brother are shown as these angry, violent brutes who even beat Naru up. I'm not an expert on Native American cultures but this did strike me as kinda extreme, and it also bothered me in terms of the storytelling. Naru's brother obviously loves her and cares deeply about her, and the other young men who respect him and followed his order to "rescue" her must know that. Would they really behave in such a brutal, violent way towards the beloved sister of the guy who sent them to rescue her?And I think all these issues could have easily been fixed: If Naru's brother had been killed by the predator after the lion hunt, and If the other young men in her tribe had thought he had been killed by either another lion or a bear and decided to hunt that beast refusing to take the girl along whose story about the "monster" they didn't believe, our heroine would have had a more sympathetic reason to go after that hunting party: both to save them AND to avenge her brother by killing the monster. Instead, the script almost makes it look like she's partly responsible HER rescue party gets killed, because she blindly follows her ambition.Another huge issue: what's up with the Frenchies? They discover a helpless Native American girl in a trap and decide: she MUST KNOW something; she has to help us catch the Predator - err... why? Mr Alien Trophy hunter has only just arrived, and we've seen him work his way up from snake, to wolf, to bear, to Native American - but the French haven't even met him yet (if anything, they only caught a glimpse, plus the dude's invisible), so why are they now all so hell-bent on catching it? Even if they had found the body parts of the other Native Americans - why would they care, let alone deduct what that thing's intention was or conclude that they should drop all their activities to catch it with the help of our heroine?The Frenchies hunt for fur which they can sell - where's the profit in investing all your energy in this predator hunt? Did I miss something here? Absolutely none of their actions or their behavior make sense. If on the other hand the script had set up a scene where we learn that the whole French party had come under attack by the Predator, and it's now a question of survival for them to learn how to defeat it, then their actions would become understandable. But there is no such scene.Another example for the sloppy writing: The plant that lowers the body temperature to such a degree that the predator literally doesn't see those who have eaten it (and the effect already works mere seconds after the plant has been ingested) is an incredibly dumb plot device. I can believe an alien trophy hunter coming to earth, but I have a hard time suspending my disbelief to the point where this "magic" plant exists that can drop your temperature from 36 degrees Celsius to as low as your surroundings (if I'm not mistaken there's even snow flakes falling during the end fight, so it must be pretty cold - but you'd be in a coma already if your body temperature dropped to only 30 degrees Celsius). Also, how quickly the heroine realizes it's the plant that's responsible for the predator not seeing the wounded translator guy is just plain laughable.Another huge shortcoming of the script is that the protagonist has zero character arc: Naru remains exactly the same stubborn, ambitious person that thinks she's better than all the others from the beginning of the film until the last frame, without even so much as a hint of any inner-growth. At the end, when she gets celebrated by her people (because surprise, surprise: she DID prove herself), she relishes that moment. She sees a little girl that looks at her with admiring eyes and is proud to be a role model for the next generation of female warriors/hunters. Yet after all she went through - is that really how she should feel? I mean, after she decided to go Predator hunting - and the script fails to give her a credible reason other than that she's desperate to prove herself to her people - a whole rescue party led by her brother went after her, and all of those young men - including her brother - suffer horrible deaths.Yet nothing in Naru's final moment of triumph reflects that terrible loss. If anything, I would have expected our heroine to realize that this was a very sad victory, and that her moment of triumph wasn't really one to celebrate, since seemingly most of the young men in her tribe have perished. This was another wasted opportunity by the writers in my opinion: if they had shown Naru distraught at the end when she gets celebrated by the whole village; if we had seen her with an empty stare at the moment she achieved her goal to prove her worth, they could have given her character more depth (and at least a little bit of an arch).Overall, it's still a watchable movie, I just wish the script had tried to explore Native American culture in a realistic way and dared to bring something original to the table. The fantastic premise lends itself for more than just a YA action adventure with some added gore, because the predator and the Native Americans reflect each other in interesting ways: both highly value the art of hunting a worthy adversary; even the collection of trophies from defeated foes (scalps for the humans - skulls for the predator) is very similar. This could have been an intelligent thrill-ride exploring those parallels, but unfortunately they opted for bland action instead.

As a lifelong fan of this franchise I am admittedly biased. Since the revolutionary classic first film, Fox/hollywood have made 4 sequels all of which I have thoroughly enjoyed/ still critiqued. A perfect sequel hasn't been made imo and may never be, but I can say this new film has the closest effective wilderness ambience/suspense to the first film and that warrants great praise.I was skeptical with a few things judging by the trailer but seeing the final product I can say that no matter the logic holes in the mismatch of Pred vs prey , the film is executed quite well. The settings are phenomenal and amplify the overall product. Dan Trachtenberg has a keen eye for detail as seen in 10 cloverfield lane and shows it once again. The costume design captures a completely different timeframe awesomely as well as shows a new more prehistoric predator that might be the coolest visually yet. Music and sound is crisp and powerful and adds so much. The acting is bare bones but for the story it has to be as far as context.It's a shame that this had to be only streaming as it should have been in theater. The scenery is fantastic. But regardless it's a surprising return to roots as far as the back to basics setting and suspense aspects. It's another welcome sequel and should be seen by any predator fan or action fan.

Its a good movie, HOWEVER when you've had a string of losses in the franchise, mediocrity can appear to be a masterpiece.First off, why does everyone speak perfect English? Its 1700 stop.Second, how does an untrained hunter become skilled in CQC. I get she practiced but disarming and killing rough men like a special forces operative?Third, you're telling me a flower lowers your body temp to invisible on infrared?Fourth, why does the brother just give up when they could have teamed up? Seems like everyone was just set up to die but the MC, hell even the dog didn't even get a scratch.Fifth, whats up with the tree kicking?Sixth, you master interstellar travel, you have active camo, laser guided bombs, laser sights, but no laser gun? Guess it being the 1700s that predator hasn't "upgraded" yet...Seventh, A predator can knock out a bear in one punch but somehow stuggles with humans...Eighth, why is the plot armor so thick to ensure she never takes a real hit from man, or beast, or Predator. When it had her by the throat... game over for everyone else but the MCNinth, how the hell is the MC faster than a deer and a predator?Tenth, How does someone fall into a mud pit and NOT retreat to the solid ground they were literally standing on a second ago, one foot behind them.Eleventh, If you create a new weapon, even a simple one, would it not take time to learn to use it? The MC is basically unstoppable and unbeatable, never do they feel in danger because you know they'll win.The hype train is gonna go long and strong with this one. People will ignore all the glaring issues, lack of character, lack of emotion, lack of anything remotely riveting. The stripped back feel is nice but they forgot to add something beyond women are better and stronger and faster then dumb old men.

1719, The Northern Great Plains: Comanche girl Naru (Amber Midthunder) is desperate to prove her worth as a hunter; when a predator comes to Earth, she gets her wish.In 1987, the galaxy's ugliest alien hunter met Native American soldier Billy, played by 6' 2½" Sonny Landham, and killed him with ease. In Prey, a predator does battle with more Native Americans, but meets his match in teenager Naru, all 5' 5¼" of her. Welcome to 2022.While not quite as atrocious as The Predator (2018), Disney's latest attempt at rebooting the Predator franchise suffers from the preposterous notion that a girl armed with sticks and stones can defeat a member of an advanced race that has dedicated itself to the thrill of the hunt. In one scene in this debacle, the predator kills a grizzly bear (just one of several unconvincing CGI animals) with its bare hands, throwing the dead animal through the air - and yet a girl with a tomahawk is able to bring down the alien in the predictable finalé. I'm all for positive female role models in film, but this is ridiculous*.The film also fails by making its alien virtually indestructible (at least until it comes face to face with Naru): the creature is stabbed, speared and shot point blank in the head, yet still comes back for more. In this film, if it bleeds, it's still bloody difficult to kill.As a plus point, the film looks amazing (digital animals aside), but nice cinematography alone doesn't make for a good Predator movie.*To those who mention Aliens, Ripley doesn't actually fist-fight a Xenomorph, at least not without the help of a power loader.3/10. I watched the original Arnie movie today to remind myself how it should be done - a stone-cold classic!

People really need to think when they write a screenplay. What could have been a great movie, perhaps as good as 1 and 2, rather than the pablum that followed, is just a foot note in predator history. The cast was ok, but the story fit the plot, not the other way around. The girl was a great tracker, ever yet fell right into a mud puddle. Why didn't the trap break her ankle? The movie was slow, too. Until the middle when it sped up. If I never watch this again, and, unlike 1 and 2 which I have and do watch I won't be sad. The unbelievable part was a 7 foot tall predator going toe to toe with a 5 foot tall woman. I know, empowerment, but believability on this was zero.Here's my big spoiler: THE DOG LIVES!!!

Damn! Watching this movie i learned 1 thing, Arnie could learn a lot from this teenage girl! She could run circles around this old war veteran who lost his whole team of war veterans and had his ass kicked by the challenge-chasing-hunt-hungry-tech-savvy oversized alien! This little girl got all jacked up in just few days, she did something big old Arnie did in years and years of hard training and fighting! Put a string on a tomahawk and all your skills reach 100 in no time! And i get it, she could not be bothered trying to save her tribe members cause she had a thing to prove - That she could hunt! It doesn't matter if she had any other motive other than to prove a point! Also, can you really be called a tracker if you have a dog sniffing around? No no no, i won't go there! I told myself i would watch the new movies and just turn off my logic! Hollywood did that years ago so i should just adapt.

I was only going to rate this until I decided to read some of the comments. This was easily the best one since the original. Not even close to me. I was hopefully when Shane Black did a "reboot" in 2018 I believe. I was disappointed. This was taking the franchise back to the basics and that was a good think! If you liked what Rogue One meant to Star Wars then this story will connect with you. I loved the cinematography. It was beautiful. The acting was really good. Don't worry that the lead actors aren't more well known. I was really not expecting much to be honest. The sequels since The Predator have been let downs. I only watched because the trailer had me with taking it so far back in time. At an hour and forty min it wasn't too short or too long. It was the perfect run time. I hope that you like Prey as much as me and that you rate and leave a comment. Happy hunting!

I think Prey did an excellent job at crafting a fresh new story. Let's face it, predictor sequels and spin-offs have felt more like a money grab. But here there's a real story that cleverly weaves a number of story lines together to spin up this intriguing edition.Amber Midthunder more than holds her own and keeps the pace moving. And the movie does a great job at leveraging the historical context for maximum effect.Big thumbs up from me.

There's a bad trend in current Hollywood entertainment to making period piece movies as modern as possible. They would have fans believe that people in earlier centuries talk like modern day Gen Z young adults. PREY is the latest in a line of movies that do this. The characters talked like they were on some CW teen drama! There's also a modern trend in female-centric action movies where the female protagonist is the only capable one among a sea of useless, beta males. Yet it was all the "useless" guys who kept saving her life in this movie! Especially her brother, who kept coming through in the clutch to make sure she survived. In the first half of the movie, she didn't seem very athletic or sporty. She looked weak, ran slow and wasn't very agile. She struggled against one of her own male tribe members who looked almost as physically slight as her. Speaking of, she performed a lot of physical stuff that didn't mesh with her small stature. That scene of her pulling herself out of the quicksand didn't look very believable. She didn't look remotely strong enough to do that. She got physically thrown to the ground a few times including hitting her head hard at least twice yet survived and even with surviving how did she not get a serious concussion and was able to function immediately after? And throughout the movie, she kept tossing her makeshift rope axe deep into tree barks and yanking it back and forth when she looked like she had all the strength of a little kid.Then after the halfway mark and AFTER her leg was injured in a bear trap, all of a sudden, she was miraculously faster and stronger than when she was uninjured, including taking out 5 much bigger guys. She got somewhat of a jump on a couple of them with a blade and I had a hard time believing she had the physical strength to wound them as she did, and the rest of them just waited their turn instead of just jumping her all at once. Also, the scene looked incredibly staged with the characters moving like they were doing an action ballet and her knowing exactly when and where to grab the blunt instruments at the perfect time to take out her attackers. And this is the only scene until the climactic battle with the alien where she seemed capable, almost like the writers needed to shove in a couple of scenes of her being badass so viewers could scream and cheer, like she actually did herself in the end. Yet none of it felt earned due to shoddy, manipulative writing. Outside of her 2 big fight scenes, she seemed pretty weak, lost, scared, and aimless. How was she so clumsy fighting someone almost as puny as her, but so agile and strong against multiple big guys and the Predator himself? Where were all of her fast reflexes and advanced fight moves early on? How come she was barely holding her own against ONE weak tribe member almost as puny as her if she could do all of this? How did she have the strength and force to be able to throw around and kick guys twice her size multiple feet? Where was all this speed and agility outside of her 2 big fights?Throughout the bulk of the film, she kept getting saved by EVERYONE: her brother, her fellow tribe members, those French-Canadian hunters who captured her, the Predator, and even by her dog, who must have saved her like 3 or 4 different times! The dog kept showing up at the most opportune times to distract whoever she was fighting so she could escape. If she was so capable, why wasn't she showing all of these abilities before? How is this manifesting at the perfect time to take on the Predator? Where's the actual development? She just could do anything the plot required her to do when the time came. And when she was inept, someone or something else would always either purposefully or inadvertently show up to save her. Like why did the lion immediately maul her beta male tribe member, yet hesitate to attack her? Why did the multi-lingual French guy not just shoot her after she killed his friends? Why did the Predator constantly ignore her when he saw she was a hunter like everyone else? I don't see how a character with the ultimate plot armor is one that I should be rooting for. Speaking of, she was also a very unlikable protagonist, more on this later. And the dog had a ton of plot armor, too. Then in the end, she beat the Predator (of course she did) again being miraculously sporty and strong doing things she couldn't physically do most of the time. How did she have any slack to move her head and body while the Predator was holding her neck into the ground? And finally, how was she in all her 100-lb glory able to DRAG the mammoth alien into the mud swamp? If anything, she's the one who should have been pulled in the opposite direction as soon as she yanked that rope, not the other way around.Now to her character's personality. Even outside of all the fake fight scenes, though, one thing that I need a character to be for me to root for them is well-written and acted, and neither this character nor the actress fit the bill. Her line delivery was incredibly bland and her "acting" consisted of making constant bug-eyed expressions. And most of her dialogue consisted of modern-sounding snark and sarcasm. And she was always short with other characters sighing and eye-rolling. It was like watching Max from Stranger Things! Lol Also, the CGI was pretty noticeable throughout most of this movie, especially the animals. And did I forget something from the original Predator in the 80s? Even when he took his helmet off, he could still see Dutch in front of him without it. Basically, sans helmet, he should still see stuff, but it's just that he didn't have his targeting device on his helmet. So in this movie, why was he unable to see without his helmet? When his helmet comes off in front of the dog at the French camp, he still should see the dog right there. It was only like a few feet in front of him. He should still see AND hear the brother was circling him doing all that screaming. He should still see the girl in the climactic scene. But it was like he was completely helpless without the helmet. Yet the '87 version could still see without it and always knew where Dutch was in their final fight. Is this a retroactive new rule made up to give the girl in this movie an extra advantage? Speaking of, why did the Predator have "ancient" laser bullets and helmet yet everything else the same as in '87. This is an advanced alien race with spaceships and ability to cloak, yet they couldn't create lasers until much later as if they are just like humans? The entire movie seemed to be about leveling the playing field making the Predator look vulnerable and dumb just to accommodate the primitive time period. She constantly got saved by all the male characters, her dog, and even the main antagonist then in the end she is shown to be smarter, better, and stronger than all of them including nerfing the Predator so that she would be able to defeat it. And it was utterly predictable from the very first frame of the movie. A "canon" story is something that feels logical and cohesive with the original and I don't believe Prey is canon. For me, there's only one Predator film from 1987 and none of these other sequels, prequels, whatever, are canon.

4* out of 10*I seem to be one of the few having issues with this film and I am truly surprised by all the positive reactions, professional reviews and praise it gets. I would rank this #5 in the series (after the OG, P2, Predators and - yes - AvP).What I do like is the setting, putting the Predator in pre-civil-war America and having it go against the Natives is a fun idea! The Predator design with the bone mask and some of its weapons are also well-done. Some spectacular visuals and set-pieces and good tension in various scenes.Naru however is quite obnoxious and her only motivation is that the wants to be a hunter. The Predator didn't even attack her or her tribe, so there was really no reason to go after it. She ends up getting the whole rescue party AND her brother killed. If she is such a good tracker, why would she walk into a mud puddle / quick sand in her own front-yard? Why would she attack the bear for god's sake - WITH AN ARROW? Also, this woman is not a good actress, she only has this one slightly annoyed and defiant facial expression.They should have had them speak Commanche with subtitles the whole way. Hearing them switch from their native language to the weirdest thick American accents was so off-putting. I mean, they had the French speak French. Would have made the film more authentic and shown more respect for the tribe's people.The CGI (in particular the animals) is pretty awful.Why would the Predator kill a rabbit, a wolf and a snake? It is known to NOT hunt the weaker - which is shown when it ignores Naru several times because she is no threat. This was completely AGAINST ITS CODE OF CONDUCT.In the finale, the Predator makes an arse of itself by getting beaten in a fist-fight by a 50 kg girl and then SHOOTING ITSELF IN THE HEAD. (How did that even go down? I really did not understand. And how on earth would Naru know how the technology works and how to use it to her advantage?). Predator kills a 500 kg bear with its bare hands and presses it overhead easily but still it can't touch her in the final fight (and I don't care if it was injured before, this is supposed to be the greatest hunter in the universe! It felt truly disrespectful towards the character of the Predator). Remember Billy, the 2m-150-kg-of-muscle native American with the huuuuge knife from the orginal movie? Well, the Predator made quick work of him.... It's great to put Predator against a strong female, they just should have had her beat it more using her wits and truly out-smarting it and not by running around and slicing it in such a stupid and completely unbelievable manner.The French are portrayed as absolutely soulless, filthy, stereotypical morons. Why would they even go after the Predator and not try to save their furs and their lives?The absolute worst and most cringy scene: Cramming in the brother having him say "IF IT BLEEDS, WE CAN KILL IT!". Although the Predator HAS NOT BLED ONCE UP TO THIS POINT. Let alone that the brother would have seen it.The more I think about this film, the more flaws I find and the less I like it.Biggest missed opportunity: They failed to have the Predator self-destruct in the end!!

This film takes a great franchise and turns it into another in a long line of feminist woke trash.Our saviour from this unstoppable evil is, of course, a powerful WOMAN!!!ALL the mem in this film (as per usual) are portrayed as evil murderers, incompetent knuckle dragger's and backward misogynists and, all will die the grisly death they so rightly deserve!The only "decent" male in the film dies halfway through and our brave and heroic female goddesses is the only thing that stands in the way of this unstoppable alien monster (which is a male).I guess the moral of the story is that women are amazing, men are useless, expendable trash that deserve to be killed.

Set in 1719 in The Great Northern Plains, Naru (Amber Midthunder) is a young Comanche woman who while trained as a healer has aspirations of being a hunter like her brother Taabe (Dakota Beavers). When Naru sees what she thinks is the "thunderbird" in the sky, she takes this as a sign she is ready to prove herself a hunter. As she joins a group lead by her brother set on taking down a mountain lion, they soon come across a creature more dangerous than they've encountered before.Prey marks the first Predator movie made and released since Disney bought Fox and the first entry in the series since the underperformance of 2018's The Predator. The film began development under the working title of Skulls when director Dan Trachtenberg and screenwriter Patrick Aison approached series producer John Davis with the initial concept that would become Prey. Trachtenberg hasn't directed a feature film his breakout hit in 2016's 10 Cloverfield Lane with a number of projects he's been attached to either moving on without him or getting cancelled with Trachtenberg's largely being on TV. Prey marks both a welcome return for Trachtenberg as well as the Predator franchise as it's probably the best entry we've had since the first one.Much like prior films Predator and Predator 2 which took established film staples such as commando and cop movies and turned them on their head with the inclusion of an alien trophy hunter, Prey takes a set of characters in its Comanche natives who could've easily sustained their own movie independent of The Predator and make for an engaging mashup with the established monster much as they did with the characters in the first and second films. Amber Midthunder is our lead Naru and she's really good in the film as she's capable in the fight scenes but also is very green which helps sell the rougher edge to the fight scenes which include some of the clumsiness you'd expect from such skirmishes. The other actors are solid performers and lend themselves to some entertaining and very brutal sequences in the film, including a sequence in the third act which had a nice nod to the ending of Predator 2. The Predator design is really unique featuring a cruder version of the helmet that more resembles a skull than the one we're used to and it works in context. We also get a solid dog character in Sarii who's pretty much a co-lead in the film and they're every bit the character you'd expect from a human actor.Prey is solid genre fare in its own right, but it also brings the Predator series back on track after getting derailed with the mess of 2018's The Predator. Amber Midthunder is a great lead as Naru and the action and spectacle delivers. The third act runs a bit long and maybe could've been streamlined, but aside from that this is great enetertainment.

Had to start a 30-day trial on Hulu just to watch it but It was pretty boss, so I'm not mad. The story was basic and took us back to the roots of the Predator franchise with its pre-America setting.Like the new predator deign but far more impressed by how the new predator moved and reacted. Whoever they got in the costume was really doing some acting, making himself look like the baddest hunter on the block. It does not stand out any better than any of the other Predator movies in my book but as far as being the first one by 20th Century Studios done under the Disney Banner it was violent and gory enough for my taste.Worth possibly getting Hulu for.

I was actually rooting for the Predator in this one. It's a horrible movie. Not even believable on the science fantasy genre. Poor directing, writing and lighting. Oh and the CGI bear looked like 1980's graphics. They had better special effects in the 1987 Predator.
46e57#$sw%%62$45@
Probably the most "serious" film in the Predator series but might as well be the most boring one, except for the AVP abominations (if you consider them as part of the franchise). Even the awful "The Predator" has more to offer on terms of plot and excitement. I appreciate the filmmakers took the movie seriously and didn't make it the silly movie that is "The Predators" but that doesn't make this one good either. Sorry, I don't understand why people like it so much. I found it pretty dull and pointless. Also, the references to Predator 1 and 2 were pretty heavy handed.

The 'Predator' films are so consistently disappointing. Every time they get our hopes up, and every time when we finally see the movie they are shattered. I suspect the series doesn't know what it is anymore. They certainly don't feel like horror movies.I couldn't think of a more boring time and setting for this movie. The Comanche people portrayed in the film have only one thing to live for - survival. So a Predator coming to pick them off isn't exactly upping the stakes for them. It is also makes it very hard for them to be personable and likable. Every character in the film other than the main girl might as well have been the exact same person.The problem with the Predator in these films has become that it is simply too powerful. It never feels like there is a fighting chance for anyone. So it's just waiting to see which style it uses to kill each person. It becomes extremely boring quickly.I just couldn't find much to like about this film. I was bored for the entire 99 minutes. It's not scary, it's not interesting and it isn't intense. 4/10.

So, a predator who is almost unstoppable and can kill a bear with his bare hands can somehow not kill a small girl and not see his own laser?.Let's not forget this guy is part of an advanced race bend on hunting other lifeforms.The movie is beyond idiotic. I didn't know that it was made by Disney, now it all makes sense.In 2022, a small girl can be better than any other male over the face of the planet, no matter the training.This movie deserves a 1 for the political agenda alone.Also, the CGI is WORSE than the original Predator movie.
46e57#$sw%%62$45@
Advanced alien vs primitives and you expected a fair fight?! The first half of the movie was totally pointless. What's an alien doing killing animals? What's he doing fighting a bear?! There was no suspense whatsoever. The fights were laughable. Plot was non-existent, cgi was below standard, and it was way longer than need be. And talk about the worst climax in any Predator series. I mean this is suppose to the the advent of Predator but man they could have at least come up with a better antagonist. This was just another ok movie not worthy of a second watch. So thoroughly disappointed.

This is my third review. IMDB has deleted my two previous ones. Apparently, I can't score this movie as a 1, for several reasons:
First, the movie is pure TRASH. Second, it's TRASH. Last, it is real TRASH.So, Disney &amp; IMDB trying to lie on scores, deleting the 1's , 2's &amp; 3's, so the hype goes on, and this trash is still scored as a 7.2.Shame on IMDB CENSORING people's opinion in 2022.

The Comanche dub version changes some of the subtitled dialogue compared with the English audio. The English audio dialog was too colloquial; it sounded too contemporary and literal, as if it could've been spoken in 2022 instead of 1719. The Comanche dub also pulls you into the movie more, and it improves the acting performances and the aesthetic of the film. It gives off a sort of an Apocalypto vibe. Bad or good accents have a big effect on a film. (Think Harrison Ford as a Russian submarine captain in K-19 The Widowmaker with his unapologetic American accent). I enjoyed Prey considerably more in Comanche dub than English audio.One criticism I wanted to address: I've read some early reviews/comments about "Comancheria", that the Comanche were horse riding peoples occupying the flatlands of Texas/New Mexico/Oklahoma, aka "Comancheria", not on foot in mountainous woodlands. They seem to think the setting was supposed to be Appalachia (it was filmed in Alberta, Canada) and therefore it isn't historically accurate. Obviously this is a bad take because this takes place in the Northern Great Plains in 1719, probably in northeastern Wyoming, which is entirely historically accurate and consistent with the range of Comanche in the early 1700's. And they did not all have horses in 1719, especially in the north at that time, horses were much more scarce than they were in the lower Great Plains. Anyway, six minutes into the film it tells you specifically that this is in the Northern Great Plains in 1719. These critics seem to know everything they know about the Comanche exclusively from John Wayne films.There are many other bad takes I've read such as the typical boring "Mary Sue" complaints. These critics don't recognize that this is essentially a David and Goliath story. David didn't defeat Goliath with brawn, but with his ingenuity, which is how Naru defeats the Predator. By the way, that's also how Arnold defeated the original Predator; his strength wasn't enough to win, he had to rig some elaborate traps. And in the end the Predators actually killed themselves in both films.The last bad take I want to address that I keep hearing about is that the Predator has a "code of honor" and Prey breaks that code several times. These critics are referencing a so-called canon in comics and books but not any of the movies, because none of the movies portray any code of honor. First of all, comics and books are irrelevant; any future writer or director can ignore them; it only matters what's on film. The Predator is a trophy hunter and a thrill seeker. There is no honor in hunting game for trophies, just like there is no honor in humans hunting lions or tigers or bears or elephants for trophies with rifles from 500 meters while dressed in camouflage and hiding from a stealth position. If the Predator had honor, it wouldn't use stealth armor. That's why Taabe shouts, "Cheater!" when the Predator turns on its stealth armor during their battle (in the dub version). In the original Predator, it discarded its stealth armor only because it malfunctioned. It then fought Arnold hand to hand after sizing him up because he found Arnold to be worthy of a fight; but that wasn't a code of honor, that was just adrenaline and anger; it was ticked off. And when it lost the fight, it decided to nuke them both- very dishonorable! The Predator in Prey fights a bear but the bear loses track of it because of the stealth armor. I don't find that to be honorable. It fought the bear because the bear was worthy of a fight like a bull is worthy of a matador. Lastly, to highlight the fact that the Predator has no code of honor, Prey features French trappers that trap and skin animals. Skinning buffalo for their furs is not honorable, just as Predator killing animals for their skulls is not honorable. But when Naru says a prayer for one of the buffalo spirits, that was a display of honor that we never see with Predator. That scene firmly establishes that the Predators do not have a code of honor.

It was watchable.Cinematography, choreography was nice. Even CGI was passable.The script was poor, but I didn't expect anything different from it.That ending though......
It was unsatisfying and felt undeserved.Mostly because of inconsistent power level of the Predator.In the first 2/3rds of the movie he is an unbeatable monster. Then he continuously gets dumber and weaker as the movie progresses.
46e57#$sw%%62$45@
This is almost as terrible as The Predators. The one with the dogs.How could anyone, (Professional critics), say it's better than the original &amp; best one yet?It is terrible. I hated everything about it. They should never make another Predator film...EVER!!!1/10.
46e57#$sw%%62$45@
This is what a Predator movie should be like. Magnificent Hero, great Predator rendition and a thrilling story. The cinematography was amazing and the surroundings really stood out. Enjoyed this one more than the last couple entries in the franchise.

Lost interest as soon as I seen the axe and rope! Yes, it's a sci-fi film but in order for the Predator to install fear to its audience, we have to feel like a real to life situation. When I seen the little girl create a futuristic axe and rope weapon I lost interest immediately. This axe has unlimited range and hits with deadly accuracy everytime she wields it. This weapons puts the the gun and bow to shame and makes me wonder why were bullets and arrows were ever invented.Just out of curiosity, why in the opening of the movie did she wake up with war paint on? Was that to sell the audience that she is an ultimate warrior in her tribe. Let the movie tell the story!P. S. If this movie is as good as some say it is, why didn't it take a shot at the box office? Better yet, make a sequel and put it on the silver screen and watch it flop like a fish out of water!

By January 2022, the book had sold 12 million copies, making it one of the best-selling books of all time. Almost everyone in the theatre, yesterday afternoon, had read the book and were wondering if the movie could be as good as the book, so in my exit poll, of a dozen, or so, viewers, I asked then specifically, "Did the movie do justice to the book?" Without exception they said it had. (Although one reader thought the movie had a more definitive ending than the book.) Their ratings were 8s, 8.5s and two 10s. When I said that anything I rated over 8 would be worthy of a rewatch, it was unanimous that all of them would rewatch it, some thinking they'd like to read the book, again. So, these people, who came to see the movie, had high standards that they felt were met.The story is simple but intriguing. There is a whole TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD vibe to it. And there is a wonderful contrast between a purity of soul living within a world of threat and danger. It was refreshing to have a film celebrate innocence. The nature shots of North Carolina are breathtaking. The casting is spot on and the performances are flawless. But the success of the film lies with the lead actor, Daisy Edgar-Jones (a very talented Brit, who earned respect for her talents in another best selling novel adaptation for television, NORMAL PEOPLE). There is a wide eyed innocence about Kya that she captures which, in turn, captivates the audience to invest in her story and her plight. (The only disconnect I had with her portrayal was not her fault but that of the production. For a swamp girl, living off the grid, her personal hygiene and wardrobe were spotless and fitted to perfection. A seemingly unlikely possibility considering her environment.) I would definitely see this film again and am tempted to buy the audible book. I give this film an enthusiastic 9 (beautiful and touching) out of 10. {Drama}
46e57#$sw%%62$45@
Read the book. Loved it. This is not one of those reviews that says movie ruined the book. It is different in the book tho. Daisy Edgar Jones is a great actress and does nothing wrong here but is totally unlike the vision of Kya in my head. The best thing about the movie is the cinematography. With no sound this movie would be lush. The dialogue is clunky though, a lot of the supporting actors wooden particularly the love interests. The courtroom scenes are predictable. David Straitharn is great as a cut price Atticus Finch. The middle section of the movie lags and feels like a Hallmark movie , however by the end I was sucked in and left the cinema smiling.Plot synopsis without spoilers is basically a young girl fending for herself in the marshlands is charged with murder.Better than the mainstream reviews suggest.

Beauty in words. Beauty in images. Beauty in music. Beauty in a performance. Beauty in an actress.Where the Crawdads Sing is a well-made movie with a story and a character that keep you heavily invested. The romance aspect really works, and this is coming from a guy who doesn't normally go for romance. Pulling on your heart-strings is an understatement.I wasn't planning on watching this movie but I'm glad I did. I really enjoyed it and would watch it again. (1 viewing, opening Friday 7/15/2022)
46e57#$sw%%62$45@
The movie condenses a lot of Kya's childhood. Which I get, you don't want a 3 hour movie. But, I feel like the character relationships suffer as they end up coming across as rushed and surface level. And with the investigation portion also condensed and some timeline changes, it makes it feel like the importance of the shell necklace is underplayed.The movie was fine, all things considered. It seemed to really strike a chord with the audience I was in. But I think it could have been better. Feels like a movie you'd watch on Netflix and like...and then forget about it.

WTCS is part coming-of-age story and part To Kill a Mockingbird. Don't expect a romcom. Nor is it a film that ends on a particularly high note. But it is gripping. It's about 2 hours long and not a minute of it is wasted. The protagonist is a wonderful actress who develops her character to the max. The supporting cast is excellent. The portrait of her pain of abuse, abandonment, mistreatment by the locals, betrayal, and isolation is enough to bring on the tears. If you have ever suffered such in a grand way, this film will hit you hard.

It is so refreshing to have plausible people going through the travails of life without the typical superheroes and cartoon buddies coming to save everyone!This film has a genuine plot and offers a depth to its characters that is surprising and satisfying.An unqualified 10 stars.

I must first confess that I had low expectations for this but was excited before it came out because Daisy Edgar-Jones was in it; she delivered a wonderful performance and I'm glad the movie gave me actual reason to still love it after watching. I left the cinema with a smile on my face but when I looked at peoples reviews after I was disappointed a lot of them don't think it's as good. Some criticisms were based on the fact that the author of the novel the movie is based on is currently wanted for murder from what I've deduced, and I don't think that's a valid way to judge the movie, only the author herself. But there are other criticisms on the movie itself which I don't entirely agree with because I thought it was pretty good. Now of course I know people have different tastes in genres, myself included so I always try to write my reviews objectively with impartial mind. So I do know there are movies or series I like, even love, that might not necessarily be the best in the world or be peculiar like "talking to girls at parties" for example which I love and I know is weird; but this is not the case this time and I think this movie is better than it's said to be.Other criticisms were also based on the argument it isn't as good as the book, and I don't often read those wholeheartedly because I've never heard anyone say they were satisfied a movie was as good or even better than the book. Movies rarely live up to the book's reputation so it's not a criticism I've always attached to any one specific movie.There's a melancholic start to the movie and it carries that throughout, we see Kya growing up with an abusive father. All I knew of the movie before watching was from the trailer which only teased it was going to be a crime mystery thriller/drama, so I didn't expect it to end up being so sad and slightly beautiful in a way. Her childhood was tough and sad when her father was around, and when he wasn't anymore it got even worse, she had no family and was deemed an outcast but as the movie progresses we see her resilience. Only surviving at first but eventually prospers on her own in the marshland. The movie doesn't follow a linear timeline and at this point we get to see her suspected of murder in present day, all based on a hat, that was barely enough evidence and it hurt to see her go through that.Things then change, it goes from being a crime thriller to a love story, and I love a good love story. I thought there were a lot of cliches; script lines like 'I care too much for you- that's why we can't be together' with Tate or finding out Chase was engaged but still pursuing Kya. Another cliche was when she was afraid Tate would forget forget her, I've always found it annoying when pretty girls/women have said they're scared about you meeting other pretty girls. At this point in the movie I was annoyed because why can't one of them just be good, anyway ticks the box for the men are trash agenda. I was so sad for the most of the movie and just praying someone stays for her. This was all cliche but I thought it was all packaged in such a way that made it so heartfelt and emotional.As the movie goes on there are several scenes that were difficult to watch. I've seen some people say it lacks depth, while that is partially true I think there is enough of it to struck an emotional reaction from you. And it might have ended up being too long in they tried to give more. As something that's based on a novel you can tell some scenes are rushed and details left out.The movie turns away from the love story towards the third act and focuses more on Kya's court case. Throughout the movie we get to see Kya's love and admiration of the swamp more than anything, even the people in her life but who would blame her. The ending came as a shock because the story is told in a way that would let you believe that wasn't the case.Daisy Edgar-Jones gave an immaculate performance and the rest of the cast held up their end too. I didn't expect her to give a strong enough performance that would compare to her in "Normal People". While the story is littered with cliches I still think it packs emotional punch and for that I love it. I don't think a lot of movies like this are being made anymore, and I saw a few viewer ratings and movie critiques suggest it isn't like a movie much seen in this day and age, and for that too I love it. I hope you judge it based on the movie itself not the book's author's alleged crimes. It may not be the best movie you'll ever see but the early reviews seem a little harsh to me. It's better than the two out of five star ratings.Just realized it's a tough life being a Daisy Edgar-Jones fan; you see her abused in normal people, then go through an apocalyptic event in War of the worlds, then kidnapped and eaten alive in Fresh, and now you get to see her hurt and lose everybody she loves in where the crawdads sing. When will it end?

Based on a popular novel with an intriguing storyline, this could have been a smashing film if it had been constructed better. It lacks intensity by not showing the devastating results of being an abandoned child, lonely, scared and hungry. It seems to gloss over all of that, and so we miss her transformation because she's shown as always being all right. I would have loved to see a wild child as main actor exhibiting all the angst of being unloved, and then she transforms in to a strong woman.Getting back to my headline, there is beautiful photography and a sense of nature we don't often see.

A relatively straightforward story of the life of a woman who lives on the edge of society as a recluse in the marshlands. Apart from the setting, it's a familiar story which shows the events of her life and how those who don't conform are often persecuted for no good reason. Good acting and scenery and the drama is well told, although the court proceedings were a bit bland and everything seemed a bit too clean to be believable.

I read the novel 4 years ago and loved it. Did I wish this movie was more suspenseful and more "gritty". Yes, tho, still the movie was well made and well acted and I ended up crying a couple times in the movie. The mood is very somber and serious. It is not a silly romantic com. It is a serious romance exhibiting serious issues of abuse and heartbreak and murder and the wrath of nature.

The critics have been slamming this movie but I thought it was good. It's not the greatest thing ever or anything like that but I thought the story was interesting and the acting was good.

This, dear ones, is a perfect example of what happens when you hand a brilliant best seller to a group of filmmakers that are NOT qualified to adapt it.Everything about this film was absolute disappointment. Why did a woman with next to NO feature film experience direct this?!For starters- casting was WRONG. I'm sorry, but our lead actress fell short on so many levels here. Appearance aside, I feel sorry for the weak, exposition filled script she was given. On the other hand, she NEVER brought the heat, the feral strength that Kya so desperately needed. She was flat, uninspiring, and- hate to say- I SAW her work. Nothing felt effortless or natural.The screenplay was disjointed, antiquated, and elementary. What a HUGE miss if an opportunity to bring gritty writing into this haunting environment.Cinematography- FLAT. Mid shots the whole way through. No energy, no elements of a period film with style- just commercial. I'd expect this from a CW show.What a shame. $44M budget?! Where?!Applause for a story about something other than a superhero- but what a let down. I'll stick to the book.

Greetings again from the darkness. This is the kind of movie that requires upfront disclosure: have you read the book or not? Since it was number one on New York Times best seller list for 2019 and 2020, and remained on the list for almost three years, it's a legitimate question and likely the driving force behind Reese Witherspoon producing the film. I have not read the book and came in with only a few preconceived notions, and enough background information to make it more interesting, not less. This is director Olivia Newman's first film since her debut FIRST MATCH (2018), and Lucy Alibar (BEASTS OF THE SOUTHERN WILD, 2012) adapted the screenplay from the enormously popular novel written by Delia Owens.Kya Clark is the youngest child of Ma (Ahna O'Reilly) and Pa (Garret Dillahunt). We get a quick glimpse at their strained existence in the marshes of Barkley Cove, North Carolina in 1953, including the violent abuse administered by Pa. It doesn't take long for her parents and siblings to abandon her, leaving young Kya (JoJo Regina) to fend for herself in what most would consider a harsh environment. But Kya becomes one with nature. Though illiterate, she draws and charts local bugs, bird, and water creatures, while scrounging out a meager living thanks to assistance from local black store owners, Jumpin' (Sterling Macer Jr) and Mabel (Michael Hyatt).Daisy Edgar-Jones ("Normal People", FRESH, 2022) plays older Kya, the one townspeople refer to as "Marsh Girl". Sensitive local boy Tate (Taylor John Smith) shares Kya's interest in nature and teaches her to read and write ... surely having little to do with her being the prettiest marsh girl you've ever seen. When Tate heads off to college, adding another to the Kya abandonment roster, she's pursued by local rich boy Chase (Harris Dickinson). This becomes another in the film's storylines when Chase turns up dead after a fall from a fire tower. Despite no footprints, no fingerprints, and very little evidence, Kya is charged with murder and faces the death penalty. A local nice guy attorney (David Strathairn) takes the case and shy, withdrawn Kya provides little help in her defense.So let's chat about what's good and not so good. The Kya character is fascinating and certainly worthy of being the centerpiece of a story. There are similarities to other stories about those who were raised outside of society. NELL (1994) and Tarzan come to mind, but despite the marsh environment, Kya never is a wild creature, and only as a child do we see her dirty and unkempt. This is a flaw, as Kya should be more raw and primitive ... at least until her mentoring by Tate. It's a mystery how Kya is as smart and clean and refined as she appears, since it's mostly just the store owners who provide even a dash of support. The structure of the film is decidedly fluid - bouncing from timeline to timeline and from story to story. This kind of structure requires superb writing, something that just isn't in the cards. The courtroom drama and murder case against Kya are especially lightweight and sloppy. Most of it makes little sense and bears almost no resemblance to what an actual trial would look like. Instead, it's slick for dramatic effect.The cliches are to be expected, and Ms. Edgar-Jones is to be commended to making the most of a role that often requires her to sit with bowed head or gazing at nature. The narration is odd, with an inordinate number of words jumbled up to initially differentiate between a marsh and a swamp. The love story seems pulled directly from a romance novel, and in fact, that's probably the best description of his, rather than a murder mystery. Chase and Tate are textbook examples of the extremes of men, and Kya's Pa adds fuel to the argument that most men are experts at letting down women. Kya's attention to nature and emphasis on survival instinct vs morality are used multiple times to guide us toward the ending, which evidently is supposed to be a twist reveal. Cinematographer Polly Morgan inserts some nice shots of nature, and the music from Oscar winning composer Mychael Danna (LIFE OF PI) is excellent. Taylor Swift's new song, "Carolina" plays over the closing credits. It's not likely a film that will win over anyone who wasn't a fan of the book, but those devoted readers will surely be on board.It should be noted that a story more interesting that what we see in the movie, is the real-life events of writer Delia Owens and her husband from their twenty plus years in Africa. This includes a murder case with some curious similarities to what she wrote about. If you are interested, track down the 2010 New Yorker article, "The Hunted", researched and written by Jeffrey Goldberg.Opens in theaters July 15, 2022.

Wow! This movie flawlessly develops into a heartwrenching but beautiful tale. It is a Heartfelt and moving story of an unfortunate child that suffers the consequences of living in a broken family that ends up growing up by herself in the marshes in NC.I can't see another actress playing this role better than the newcomer British actress Daisy Edgar Jones; she is perfect for this role with her innocent look and tremendous acting skills. She deserves a nomination when it Is awards season. The cinematography is breathtaking that enhances the story beautifully.The people love this film except the movie critics. People ratings in flixster is at 97% not surprised at all. This is a beautiful film that deserves seeing in the big screen. It is one of the best films in 2022.

Generally, this is a great film. Daisy Edgar Jones gives it her all and the tone is fairly constant and intriguing.I've never actually read the book it's based on, but rest assured that you don't need to have read the original to understand this sad, beautiful tragic movie.The only issue with the film is how rushed the last few minutes are. After the court makes their verdict, which I won't spoil, the writers really do their best to wrap up the film and don't leave much room for the revelations to follow the climax.That aside, it's an enticing and thrilling movie that anyone (above the age of 10, at least) should enjoy.

Preposterous plot. An abandoned six-year old fends for herself in the marsh. Not a single adult comes to check on her. Or reports her to the authority. She grows up to become a famous illustrator. I don't think she ever went to a dentist, yet her pearly white teeth sparkle. Not to mention her shaved legs. I just kept shaking my head all throughout the movie. Kya, the main character needed long term therapy for all the trauma she experienced. Both parents abandon her separatelyWith a few exceptions, the acting was abysmal. I already mentioned the plot. I saw the reviews before I went into the theater, so the burden falls on me for going anyway. No excuse for you.

The story of Kya, the Marsh Girl, is one that quickly sucked me in. I felt like I had been transported to a world of magic and wonder and the added mystery of a small-town murder with bias toward the main character made for an excellent depiction of 1960s North Carolina and how prejudice can lead to tragedy and a shocking fate can be found even though innocently commenced. Kya's a peculiar girl, but truly hers is a tale of triumph and strength and finding a way to survive the world by finding sanctuary in a place free of discrimination where nature's laws rule and freedom means risking everything. It's a fabulous story and remarkably filmed with a lovely ending that left me thrilled and equally as stunned.

My Review - Where the Crawdads Sing-My Rating 10/10
See this at a Cinema pleaseI looked back at nearly 500 of my reviews over 5 years IMBD and Where the Crawdads Sing is the 40th movie or television series and that's only 8% in total so it's an indication to me of how often I give that perfect score and in this case it's fully deserved .What impresses me most about this beautifully crafted and beautifully written story is it's nostalgia and homage to the great movie makers of the past who gave us great screen adaptations of best selling novels.Movies like To Kill a Mockingbird 1962 , Picnic 1955 , Prince of Tides 1991 , Gone With the Wind (1939) Driving is Daisy 1989, Fried Green Tomatoes 1991 ,
Splendour in the Grass 1961 and even Breakfast at Tiffany's 1961 because like Audrey Hepburn Daisy Edgar-Jones a 24 year old British Actress gives a radiant performance and in my view the is the best casting choice in a role since another British Actress Vivian Leigh . Vivian Leigh was about the same age as Daisy Edgar -Jones when chosen out of 100's to play the greatest Southern Belle Scarlet O'Hara in 1936.I remember being so impressed with Daisy Edgar -Jones in the Irish Drama romance series Normal People I'm certain the sky's the limit for this fine actress .Daisy Edgar -Jones who has that rare quality of having a love affair with the camera you just can't take your eyes of her character Kia Clark in this movie .I also couldn't take my eyes off Taylor John Smith who plays Tate Walker who reminded me so much of Paul Newman in this movie ,perhaps a cliche but so right for this ambitious handsome all American boy.I haven't read Delia Owens novel so can only give my opinion of the film version with and the wonderful screenplay by Lucy Aliba .I didn't realise that a Crawdad is a freshwater crayfish and that they don't sing at all . I was expecting a Crawdad to be a Native American Aquatic bird like a loon .The title comes from Kya the central character of the story's interpretation of the phrase " where the crawdads sing .It means far in the bush where critters are wild and still behaving like critters or a place to embrace nature removed from people and society.Kya Clark is known as The Marsh Girl by locals of this North Carolina marshland village living in a modest hut on her own after being abandoned by every member of a family torn apart by a drunken abusive father.Kya loves lives and breathes the solitude of the marshes which is greeted by scorn and rejection by most of the townsfolk except Mabel and Jumpin' a coloured couple and storekeepers who show kindness and friendship to Kya .Her first boyfriend handsome Tate Walker can see Kya's great talent for drawing the creatures of nature she loves so much and encourages her writing by teaching this intelligent but illiterate young girl to read and write.Michael Hyatt plays Mabel and Sterling Macer Jr are impressive in their roles .North Carolina in the 1950's 1960's wasn't an easy time for Afro American business owners and there are some understandable racial overtones in the story.David Strathairn is superb cast as Tom Milton a retired attorney who has known Kya and shown her kindness takes on the task of defending this young girl accused of the murder of a young man Chase Andrews who is found dead in the marshes . Harris Dickinson is also very good as Chase an opportunistic edible bachelor and just one more man cut with the same abusive cloth of Kya's father.No more plot lines but Lucie Alibar who co wrote the screenplay for Beasts of the Southern Wild also set in a similar setting in the Louisiana Delta region about and coincidentally also about a young girl was an ideal choice to bring this story to the screen .I really don't like the term womens picture but it's a compliment in this case to Reese Witherspoon and her Media Company Sunshine for producing this fine film. Its great to see influential and talented Hollywood women like Reece Witherspoon and Margo Robbie whose Production LuckyChap Entertainment are providing unique opportunities for women writers Director's and screenplay writers that may have got rejected by the old male dominated movie moguls .A case in question is the upcoming movie Barbie I certainly couldn't imagine a group of male executives investing millions of dollars in a film about the worlds most famous fashion doll?The Director of Where the Crawdads Sing Olivia Newman has only made one feature movie First Match a critically well received movie also about a teenage girl from Brooklyn who decides to join a boys wrestling team to get closer to her father.This movie is definitely the best film I've seen so far this year and stands tall with my other favourites of recent times The Power of the Dog , West Side Story , Being The Ricardo's ,Nightmare Alley ,Don't Look up and The Chicago Seven.The publicity sheet for the film reads - Every creature does what it must to survive and that's the line that will stay with me long after my first viewing of this fine film which in time will be seen as a Classic movie .

Copping a fairly decent critical drubbing from reviewers across the globe, with a Rotten Tomatoes score entrenched in the lowly 30's, Olivia Newman's high-profile adaptation of Delia Owens hugely popular novel is a surprisingly engaging and faithful imagining of the tale of The Marsh Girl and her fight to prove her innocence in a town that has long pigeonholed her into a character they believe her too be.Capturing the time and place this story takes place in across the 1950's and 60's, Newman brings Owen's world to life in vivid fashion as we are introduced to the isolated yet beautiful world of Kya Clark, played by rising star Daisy Edgar-Jones, as the brave and determined soul learns to live in the face of insurmountable odds as her love triangle with the kindly Tate Walker and the arrogant Chase Andrews threatens to derail her life when Andrew's is found dead in the marshlands one fateful morning.Large part romance, with sprinklings of mystery and courtroom drama thrown in for good measure, not all elements of Where the Crawdads Sing narrative work to the level you would hope for, with the courtroom scenes and some romantic interludes no better than day time soap operas, but there is enough working here to make Kya's journey one that's going to strike a chord with many, much like Owen's book managed to do over the last couple of years.Key to the films success outside of its stunning locations and ability to bring the deep south too life before our eyes is the lead performance of Edgar-Jones, who manages to overcome some frosty at times chemistry with her male leads (with the Kings Man's Harris Dickinson feeling like a wrong choice for football star Andrews) to deliver another noteworthy performance in a career that is building before our eyes and thanks to her fine work here, the trials and tribulations of Kya's personal experiences makes for heart- wrenching and heartwarming material that is sure to please fans of the book hoping that their heroine will be given justice in this Reese Witherspoon backed feature.Unlikely to ever be regarded as a classic adaptation of a divisive yet undeniably gripping book, Newman's film is far better than its been given credit for by the critical realm, who seemed lined up with their pitchforks well before they had even laid eyes on this drama that features one of recent memories most memorable protagonists.Final Say -Working more often than not, Where the Crawdads Sing is a faithful and well-shot version of Delia Owen's hugely popular book and provides justice to a fictional character that is one of the most intriguing literary creations of modern times.3 1/2 birthday cakes out of 5.For more reviews check out Jordan and Eddie (The Movie Guys)

The themes here are under-explored, the characters are unconvincing, and the pacing was exhausting. Perhaps the worst and most immediate criticism I had while watching this film was how unconving the setting of the marsh was. It was too vibrant, lacked atmosphere, and, if I'm honest, played no significant role in the plot. It should have, but it didn't. For a gril who lives in the marsh and raised herself there, Kya is awefully clean and her face made up all the time. This is just perfect for a girl in a Hallmark story, not a girl from a marsh. She's surprisingly well adjusted for everything she's been through also. Not sure who to blame on that one as I haven't read the book. If you want brainless romance, this is for you. If you don't want to hear a courtroom full of people gasp at a bunch of dull evidence, avoid this.
46e57#$sw%%62$45@
Ok, the girl is ostracized by the locals because she lives alone in the marshes. She raised herself in a shack after the family leaves one by one. She's illiterate but after a few reading lessons from Prince Too Charming, she's articulate and ready to become an author of books about the local marsh critters.Now the town considers her another marsh critter. Here's the problem; she's perfect!She's pretty, smart, clean and has perfect teeth. Just like you'd expect from a dweller of swamps.The 2 male jerks look like the frat boys from Animal House. Everyone is too good looking. It's such BS. I didn't buy these actors for a second. It was like a rom com without the comedy. Oh yeah, there are very clichéd courtroom scenes thrown in at random. More courtroom and less kissing DBs would have helped but not a lot.

LIKES:Good Pace for Most of Movie: Movies like this are always a challenge for me depending on so many factors that fans of this series enjoy. In this regard, the pacing works for me on a lot of the movie, as it tries to balance the crime elements, the love element, and the drama element to a point that is entertaining and yet sincere. Owens adapted book gives you plenty of time to enjoy both major acts of Kya's story, and yet does not get bogged down too much into a bloated spectacle that would require a movie series to accomplish.The Music as a Tool: I'm a sucker for much of the movie process and finding the ideal way to deliver the full moment of the scene. In this film, the music is a solid tool used to amplify and make the scene pop out a little more than simply talking. The soft piano touches, use of the track to show off the joy of the moment, and even some other instruments all help raise the bar of the scene's essence and bring with it that solid bam factor that most enjoy seeing in their film and breaking past that awkward silence. It's balanced well for me and I thoroughly enjoyed the tracks and pieces selected and conducted in this work to help things "sing" a little more.The Setting/Cinematography: A good movie knows how to build or find the right place to shoot, and Crawdad's location is very welcoming to a good drama/mystery film. Marshes offer so much in the way of the ecosystem, and give you so many tiny worlds to explore and hide in when the moment comes for it. All the shots during scene transitions were gorgeous to me, the wild life mixed with the lighting of the natural (and artificial) world coming together to really pull you into the setting of the Carolina community. Even during the building scenes, there is a nice natural feeling to most of the pieces they picked to again make me feel I was in a store, or at the town center. And when the light needed to be adjusted, it did well not to overwhelm, but also not leave us in the dark at the same time.The Presentation of The Story to A Point: I've never read the book, but my guess is that Owens did switch back and forth between the trial and the past on a regular basis. This style is always intriguing to me and I always love seeing how they used the past to influence the present in a movie. For films like Slumdog Millionaire, this style really works, while for this film there are times it is done just as well for emphasizing and keeping you into the story. Crawdads has the moments in the trial to set the next scene of Kya's past, fueling the case a little and helping him draw conclusions as to what the truth is. Again, it worked well for me, and kept characters integrated, though there is a limitation I'll mention in dislikes.The Emotional Piece Work: This is more so about the characters, but Owens writing was adapted well to show the emotions of this little community during this trying time. Crawdads got a lot of emotional punches to throw in this film, hitting those drama switches with unwavering hesitation that will make fans of the soap opera style of theatrics cry, as it did for several members in my showing. I did find myself relating to aspects of the characters, and found most of their development and presentation balanced to the added spice the studio throws on to assist. Regardless, I welcomed the emotion in this movie and found it very satisfying to include and present the way they did in this movie.The Writing: When you have someone put strong dialogue in your book, you get strong dialogue in the script it seems. I was very impressed by some of the lines in the movie, again finding variety in how they would be spoken depending on the character who delivered the lines. Some of them are in those inspirational speeches you love to reference in life to drive you to do great things, others are the lovey dove lines that will swoon your hearts, and some are just straight up sweet and wholesome. This variety is welcome and helps with the characters and emotional work mentioned previously, giving our cast a solid well to pull their work from and use.The Acting: Hands down, the acting was the biggest plus for me for this film. Where the Crawdads' cast is sensational and really is one of the biggest pillars, I feel, to help establish the characters and lines I mentioned earlier. Tom Milton probably had my favorite lines of the movie and my favorite balance, with patience, sincerity, and that wisdom you need to guide the film along. As for the younger cast, we start with Dickinson, who I found to be the weakest of the three, but this may just be due to his character. His portrayal of Chase is a little forced and over the top at times and I think that there was a better, less hyperbolic way to play the character he did. It's not the worst by far, but... seeing other people play more complex roles, I expected a little more balance. Smith is a role that goes super well in the moments he is there, finding that character that will be loved by a lot of people for both love component and earnest components that makes for a great character. He seems sincere in the role, and I love the flaws and strengths he balances to be a character you hope to see a lot of. As for Edgar-Jones, I loved a lot of her performance and just how well she played the Marsh Girl role, finding again elements of hurt, strength, and hope that kept within the lines of equilibrium I like to see. Did she go into the soap opera moments and have a few political lines? Sure, but they did not feel as forced and again were part, not the whole, argument of her character. I really enjoyed her being the point that crossed them all and she did a splendid job of holding the torch.DISLIKES:Pace Is Boring at Times: No surprise, the action lover does like things to be a little more pushed, if possible, when the movie does not maximize other elements. Owens work in this film adaptation feels a little drawn out on certain elements that only need to be drawn out occasionally for me. Long winded kisses, staring into their eyes, and some other moments would have been fine for me, but only if they were able to incorporate it more into the other elements of the story. There was just something missing, some disconnect, that made the pace feel off balance for me, given that Nicholas Sparks' romance does little to impress me.A Little More Character Balance: Another element, even if written in the book, was how the characters sort of don't feel quite balanced in use for the film adaptation. Without reading the book, I can't tell if this matches the quality of the acclaimed novel, but in this film, there was more time needed for including all the characters they did. More of the shopkeepers influence on Kya's life, more of the focus on her family that she thought of, even more of the character Tate, were needed for me to really integrate the whole community together in that way I envision the book does. But time and money budgets are always the giants to battle in a movie production vs. The limitless budget of the imagination.Needed Some Edge: It's a movie portrayed as one girl's struggle to the survival in the marsh and prove her innocence during this crime. That sounds like a movie with edge and thrills that requires some intensity, close calls and stakes. I did not really feel any of that in this movie, even during her travels in the marsh and the dangers it held. This movie felt again like a Sparks movie, and did little to up the ante or the danger of Kya's survival. Because of this, the selling point of the trailers was grossly overdone and instead became more of that romance drama I always expected it to be.The Crime Element Is Lacking: Finally, the crime element is missing for me in this film, or more so the journey that made it worth including in this work. As mentioned earlier, going back and forth to find the clues of this crime is a great strategy if done well, but for me this was not done well and quite honestly was disappointing to me. I wanted to see the pieces of the crime come together as her life continued to unfold. I wanted her friends and others to testify and provide those uncertainties and twists that complicate the crime. And I wanted that oh snap moment where the case circles back and the killing blow is dealt. That is what I wanted, but sadly did not get. This is what I meant by the complicated delivery feeling both good and bad, and really it will come down to expectations and your knowledge of the book to determine how much you like this element.:
The VERDICT:
Where the Crawdads Sing is by far a beautiful movie in terms of style, vision, and cinematic work that I love seeing in a film. It's got solid romantic portrayal, a very good cast of characters, and some fantastic writing to make come alive, alongside actors who do their jobs well. I feel many will like this movie, but without reading the book, I can't say that the expectations will be met. The movie has some pacing issues and character use issues for me, while also lacking the edge and organization a crime movie is supposed to have to be engaging. That element is why I felt disappointed with the work, but if you go for the romance aspect, you'll be able to ignore that feature for the swooning love in this movie. Based on my experience, this is a movie deemed to be watched at home instead of at the theater. Thus, my scores are:Drama/Mystery/Thriller: 7.5
Movie Overall: 7.0.

I have not read the book but the film though fabulously beautiful to look at is something of a damp wet Tuesday afternoon yarn more suited to Television than the big screen. The situation is hardly credible and the plot is wildly melodramatic but has at least a surprise twist that is not badly handled. Nonetheless, the epilogue almost ruined the movie for me, the story certainly did not benefit from even more slop.

Please ignore the wannabe film critics in these reviews. It's an enjoyable film - actually my favorite of the year so far. Each actor does an amazing job of making you feel the emotions you're supposed to and really draws you in. It's not a fast-pace movie, and I actually liked that element. The only reason it gets 9 stars is because of the "much anticipated" Taylor swift song in the credits. Pass.

This movie isn't terrible. But it's not good. As a comedy it fails. I laughed only a few times, almost exclusively at the cat. Most of the jokes were crickets in my audience and a bunch made me roll my eyes.As a sci-fi movie it fails. It gives us the most basic child version of several sci-fi concepts stolen from other movies like Interstellar. And if you think for more than a few seconds, so much of it doesn't make sense. There was a cool fight scene and a couple of good action moments, but for the most part I found myself not caring about the action.The movie does this thing where it keeps throwing a wrench in the plan, creating obstacles that the characters must overcome. This is normally a good strategy and makes any later success feel earned and satisfying. But every obstacle is a result of dumb characters, silly mistakes, or simply being clumsy. This makes it hard to stay invested. When this strategy is executed better, there is a much better reason for the obstacles, such as a really smart antagonist.Late in the movie, it goes in a direction that I wasn't a fan of. And we get a few ridiculously cheesy moments, one that made me cringe so hard it hurt. The great animation doesn't make this worth watching.P. S. The mid- and post-credits scenes are absolutely not worth the wait. (1 viewing, early screening IMAX 6/15/2022)

I enjoyed the first thirty minutes or so of Lightyear. The pacing was decent and the humor/heart was in the right place. Once the twist in the trailer happens the story becomes a beautifully predictable entry for Pixar, and my five year old became incredibly antsy to leave the theater. Socks steals the show but that isn't enough to enliven a boring plot. Wait for Lightyear to stream on Disney+.
46e57#$sw%%62$45@
It wasn't the best Pixar film but it definitely wasn't the worst. Why it gets such a low score on here I'll never know. I'll admit the trailer did make it look better than it actually was but it was still decent and funny.

Lightyear is a spin-off the Toy Story franchise, and a film-within-a-film, as the intro text has it as the movie that resulted in Andy getting his Buzz Lightyear action figure. In this, Buzz Lightyear tests a new hyperfuel for Star Command that ends up taking him 84 years into the future, where the colony on T'Kani Prime is taken over by the evil Zurg, forcing him to recruit a team of misfits to fight back.Okay, I am not going to lie, as a fan of the Toy Story films and the Buzz Lightyear of Star Command cartoon (which Pixar hates so much, they made this movie to retcon it), I am not impressed. While I have heard about the controversy, I will not put that into focus due to people already talking about it to the point of overkill (as it was a cut scene Disney reinstated as a form of protest). While I did like Chris Evans voicing Buzz (as he is a spot on with Tim Allen and Patrick Warburton), my main complaint with this film is that it's not up to the standards we know Pixar to be capable of with films like Luca, Turning Red, and their classics like The Incredibles, Monsters Inc, and of course, Toy Story. The story is a subpar science fiction story involving time travel and misfit heroes, which have all been done a lot. Also, a lot of the characters are a hit or miss. While I did like Sox, the robot cat who is Buzz's main companion, a lot of the others, Izzy, Mo, and Darby I did not like so much, as while they are unique, like Darby being paranoid and a paroled convict, they don't hold a candle to Mira Nova, XL, and Booster, who will be the true Team Lightyear to me. Even Zurg suffers from this, as the twist about his identity, while I will not spoil, seems a bit cliche, and I will treat as non-canon. Yeah, while it's not the worst Pixar film, it's not one of the good ones, and I recommend sticking to the classic Toy Story films as well as finding episodes of Buzz Lightyear of Star Command on sites that upload cartoons until Disney has the right mind to put the series on Disney+

I saw this in the theater with my 6 year old. She fell asleep and I almost did too...boring, nonsensical, inconsistent, and worst of all, not funny. What was the point?Should have been free to watch on Disney plus.
46e57#$sw%%62$45@
6.4/10The nostalgia was there for ten minutes and then it went away as the story trails away into something that just didn't sit right. While we never got firm info about Buzz's origins in the "Toy Story" films. This isn't what I expected for his story. I expected this to be an emotional journey, but there were maybe three moments where a tear was shed. The rest was just "empty" space.The voice acting was good. Chris Evans sounded like Buzz and brought the character to life. The surrounding characters were just as enjoyable. Definitely some funny moments amongst them. I did get a few laughs out, but it felt forced sometimes to be able to enjoy the film.The film definitely looked, and sounded, great, but it didn't do enough to grasp a love for the character, or the story. Honestly, I don't think this film was for adults to reach back to the childhood nostalgia, but rather its for a new generation to make the character it's own meaning. Flip side to Buzz was Zurg. Zurg was perhaps the biggest disappointment with how they portrayed him. Who he was in "Toy Story" is not the same as who is here, and again, it didn't sit right.I think the biggest thing is to forget the trailer. Go in with an open-mind and make of it what you will. The kids in the theatre seemed to have loved.Overall, not the outstanding film I was expecting even with all the great visual and sound. The story lacked expectations for a nostalgic character, but wasn't necessarily terrible, so again, go in with an open-mind.Thank you for reading my review. Until next time.... Enjoy the show!

Wow I just can't believe the bad reviews. I use imdb scores and written reviews religiously and 95% of the time u think they are spot on. I watched this with my family and we were all very entertained throughout the entire movie. That should say enough. It was pretty well done and interesting.

"In 1997, a child named Andy bought a Buzz Lightyear action figure after seeing the character in his favorite movie. This is that movie." These sentences precede Lightyear, a gorgeously realized and superbly animated film which has also been finely calculated and sterilized to assuage those who greenlit its production. Despite its visual splendor, Lightyear is not always easy to look at, with the knowledge that a soulless, artless, superficial corporate entity has hollowed out the insides, and is wearing the film like a glossy, finely crafted skinsuit.The film follows Buzz Lightyear as he attempts to bring home a crew aboard "The Turnip" an exploratory vessel used by Star Command. His attempts bring about strange consequences with time, and he is quickly thrust into an unfamiliar timeline with a trio of unlikely helpers, including the teenaged granddaughter of his compatriot, Izzy Hawthorne. Together, they must stop a robot invasion and complete the mission Buzz began almost a century ago.There are a number of threads and disparate qualities to Lightyear, many of wildly varying quality, but one thing is certain; this is a proudly corporate and sterilized product. This nagging fact presents itself with the aforementioned opening lines, a reminder that the film currently being watched is explicitly and purposefully nothing more than a product consumed by a child twenty-five years ago. The message is stated not only to help Disney merchandise the film, but to remind and entice their audience about the wonderful array of products present under their corporate umbrella, their distressingly tightening grip on all entertainment. The sentiment registers early and often; this is not story, this is product.This corporate slavishness manifests itself in the typical risk-aversion attitude and spinelessness of contemporary Hollywood. Lightyear is bland; not visually, but in its story, in most of its directorial choices, and its tone. It's a painstakingly manufactured blandness, meticulously constructed to smooth over or erase the rough edges of human complication. The nature of the story and the moodiness of the animation call for a mature telling, but the writers and producers of the film clearly aren't interested in mining any potential emotional complexity or intrigue.Another irritating and telling sign of Lightyear's men-in-suits meddling is its frantic pace and fear of looking death in the eye. Buzz's story here is actually quite tragic, a futuristic vision of uncontrolled loss and temporal grief akin to Interstellar or Ad Astra. A film more attuned with its characters and their psychological needs and nightmares would nurture this tragedy, use it to frame their journey early and often. Lightyear not only blows by this thread in the pursuit of lubricating its plot, but its final twist runs totally counter to Buzz's previous motivations and desires. Buzz is not allowed to feel true human-like grief because he's not human. He's merchandise. The same could be said for all other characters.A counterargument arises: "It's just a kid's film!" But if there's any animation studio which has shown the propensity for mature children's programming in the past, it's Pixar Animation. Even goofier franchises, like Kung Fu Panda, have occasionally hit emotional paydirt because the writers were aligned with their characters, psychologically and plot-wise. When Po learns of his parents' death at the hands of Lord Shen, he mourns, and the film mourns with him. He's allowed time to focus within and process the information. He doesn't immediately stumble onto a new plot point, he doesn't mindlessly enter into a final confrontation, he doesn't make any insipid quips. Buzz Lightyear, when presented with emotionally charged material, does all three...though not in that order.The writing is simply too cartoonish for the material presented, in terms of both visual awe and narrative substance. No character is fleshed out beyond a few superficial quirks. The trio which accompanies Buzz succeeds too often in spite of themselves, careening jollily from one set piece to the next with no recognition of the stakes or danger within the film.All four characters are at least twenty-two years of age, but consistently behave like children, hooting and hollering in the face of clear and present danger. Just quip, quip, quip, quip, quip. No setups, no punchlines, few personality-driven situations; just quip, quip, quip, as if the film were ghostwritten by a prepubescent James Gunn. Again, this approach usually works in lighter, lower-staked children's material, but Lightyear promises to be something more early on. The immediacy and frequency with which the film reneges on that promise is incredibly frustrating.There is a final problem with Lightyear which is difficult to describe without spoiling. Buzz makes an all-cinema selfish decision at the film's climax, which is inexplicably framed as heroic and unquestionably morally correct. The decision is framed as such in no small part because of Disney's creative bankruptcy. It's a sad reality that the company most noted for typifying villainous roles and creating memorable, distinct, and creative threats has succumbed to believing that no one individual is ever a true villain. Everyone is simply misunderstood or morally gray. It's a shame. Another small but relevant note is the film's general lack of structure or causality. The whole endeavor feels generally purposeless, and the film struggles to sustain itself.As mentioned, for all of the film's narrative and emotional problems, there is an incredible team using unbelievable technology at work. The animators of Lightyear have created a stunning, immersive, and moody alien environment. It's staggering to look back at the original Toy Story and realize just how far the medium has come. Extensive and frequent credit must be given to the artists at work, who are undoubtably the best of their craft. Many of the sequences feel like hyper-stylized renderings of recent sci-fi extravaganzas, like the aforementioned Ad Astra or Interstellar, with just a sprinkling of 2001: A Space Odyssey for good measure. Some of the film's images are truly breathtaking.All in all, Lightyear is a typically disappointing and spiritless stab to create new life from old IP. There are many problems with the film's writing, but the central issue is Lightyear's eponymous caricature. The audience is told Andy wanted a Buzz toy after seeing this movie; even beyond the transparent cynicism of such a statement, it's hard to even believe at face value. This film's Buzz Lightyear is a mostly incompetent, insecure, rash, and boneheaded figure. Younger viewers will probably enjoy the space-age antics, but most out of grade school will feel the familiar tinge of disappointment. What could've been!

Let's be clear here: Disney is lying through their teeth. When you buy a Maui doll from Moana, you get Dwayne Johnson's voice. Disney pretending that because it's an origin story it requires a different voice actor is one of the most feeble attempts ever to avoid backlash. If it had been an origin story of Woody, you can be damn sure Disney would have cast Tom Hanks.With that out of the way, does this origin story of the Buzz toy bring Pixar a worthy return to theatrical releases? Absolutely not. This very much feels like it should have been the third Disney+ release after Luca and Turning Red. The visuals, while not the best from Pixar, are still quite good. Chris Evans does his best to fill Allen's shoes and his performance is palatable once you get over the change. But what is ultimately lacking here is any heart or substantive story. Attempting to be 'real life' events makes the whole plot feel fabricated beyond an already hardly believable story.There isn't a universe here where I want get lost in, and frankly, I don't think many viewers will, either...

This film seems to spark a lot of people to say that this film is completely terrible or that it's completely fabulous because it included a gay relationship in the periphery of the main story, and to an even lesser extent, a convict character who is sympathetic. So. I'll address that quickly: None of that seemed like a big selling-point or issue with the movie to me. And those reviewer who make the movie all about those things seem to say more about themself in their review than the movie itself.Overall I found the movie better than what I was expecting based on it's IMDB score, but still far from being a Pixar classic.The animation is very good, the story is solid even if it feels like a lot of the ideas have been done before in different ways and feels like a few ideas didn't quite work as well as possible. In some ways it reminded me of an inferior "Up". The main protagonist's circumstance were less sympathetic and more a result of his actual decisions. Overall I wonder how the movie would have looked if it had explored a B storyline for another character during some of the time-jumps. I also think the twist could have been established a little better than it was.The voice acting for the film is fine. I didn't think a lot of the comedy landed well for me. But it wasn't awful like a lot of kids movies either and didn't detract much from the drama of the main story. Overall it will be acceptable to most audiences, with the robot cat being a likely favorite character for many viewers. Most kids will probably like it a bit more than adults and not notice or care much about the politically controversial content unless their guardians have already primed them to have an major opinion about it like them.I'd say it's a good time at the theater and better than the average score right now of 5.8. But don't expect it to be a classic Pixar film like Coco, Up, Walle, or Toy Story 1-3.
46e57#$sw%%62$45@
I was disappointed. We expected more from this movie. The storyline was okay. The cat was cute, but that was it. Could've made a movie based on the cat and it would've been better. Buzz Lightyear is not the same without Tim Allen voicing the character. Two thumbs down.
46e57#$sw%%62$45@
My 7 and 8 year old were bored so much they almost fell asleep. I didn't notice if they actually did, because I did.The robot cat scenes were the best parts by far. Which is a huge problem.THIS was Andy's favorite movie? That had to be a lie.

Second Pixar in a row that I couldn't get into at all. The other one was Turning Red. The artwork in both is tremendous but what used to separate Pixar from the rest of the pack was the depth of feelings. That wasn't here at all. I didn't give a hoot about the characters at all.
46e57#$sw%%62$45@
I think this movie fails in alot of aspects to be a children movie from having very dull moments that bore kids to having more complex stories compared to other kids movies.That leaves us Adults and I don't have to explain why most adults would go watch movies like top gun and jurassic world instead of this one.Overall movie can't find its audience that's why I predict a massive failure here.
46e57#$sw%%62$45@
When 4th graders ask to leave the theatre before a Pixar is over, there are real problems. It wasn't bad, but it just wasn't good. The humour falls flat with wooden delivery, and Pixar found a way to make the characters dull.
46e57#$sw%%62$45@
Disney continues to run out of good ideas. They really can't just make something new for a change. The Toy Story universe should be dead right now and to be fair, they should never have made Toy Story 4 either. What a joke!
46e57#$sw%%62$45@
I was excited to see lightyear even with the lack of Tim Allen but as the movie progressed it was clear this was a shallow attempt at bringing back the classic feel that the original Pixar movies had this was just so bland and emotionless.it really didn't feel like a Pixar film at all.
46e57#$sw%%62$45@
It just had too many things meant for adults. There is just no way a little boy would enjoy this film. Andy's favorite film? Hardly. Maybe it was Andy's mothers favorite film. It read more like a soap opera with lots of sci-fi footage forced into it. It was technically very well done. Its just the characters and story that were no good at all for kids. But then I was there, and I was bored too.Zerg was actually not bad. The cat was good too. But there wasn't enough of that to help. The movie's problem is that it centers on very ordinary adult characters. Star Command is run by a cartoon General Millie and the losers at your job who now thankfully work from home/got laid off. If this was real, you know Zerg would have won easily a hundred times over. If Andy was a single woman I could sort of see him liking this film. The super cool rockets do make this film a lot better, but they dont make it enjoyable for child or adult.

Not sure why the reviews are so bad. I found Pretty decent movie here. Honestly I wasn't expecting that much good movie. There was a few flaw in scenerio but not important at all.I like the car character Sox. Such an excellent, funny character. Buzz team was also fun. I can't say anything bad about lightyears.
46e57#$sw%%62$45@
Honest i was not really sure about this movie since its straight out of toy story.But it delivered and was really exciting, not sure why people are giving it low ratings, and also bad reviews.
46e57#$sw%%62$45@
Not good. This movie wasn't about Buzz, but was about Izzy and her grandmother (sorry I can't remember her name, she is equally forgettable).And Buzz chooses a terrible untrained group of misfits who screws up EVERYTHING over the trained people for Star Command? Please!?! Awful.
46e57#$sw%%62$45@
The bar was set pretty high for this movie, theres no denying that. Everyone was expecting a stellar, epic sci-fi adventure movie, and what we got was... not that.The movie had a pretty promising start, but as it went on it incrementally kept sinking down. Now to be fair, the first 2 acts of the movie actually werent bad. It wasnt "excellent" by any means either, but i would say that it flew just a little below the line the trailers had set for itself.Its the third act where everything started falling apart. The villain was terribly written and weak, i get that they wanted to really push the movies moral with him but they handled it poorly. Not spoiling anything but they really screwed the movie up with that partthe characters were a bit of a bixed bag as well, some were good, others were forgettable. Buzz, izzy, and sox were all fairly enjoyable characters, mo and darby were unbearlbly bland and could have just been written out of the movie entirely.So yeah, painfully average at best. Not something i would recommend seeing in theaters. When it comes out on disney plus give it a try at home.
46e57#$sw%%62$45@
Save your money and go watch another movie, I wish they stopped with Toy Story movies, this movie is not necessary and terrible. And it's a bit too late for it, anyway, even the story and the voice acting were bad.
46e57#$sw%%62$45@
Honestly, I was quite hesitant seeing this film after seeing a lot of low reviews. I was planning to see it weeks ago and keep cancelling it, then I gave it a chance finally last night. I was initially expecting not too much, but surprisingly, it was good! A lot of emotional connections, wacky comedy and as always, visuals were at its best. If you just go see it, have an open mind and just enjoy the film as is. I do understand why many viewers gave a low rating, the pacing is not that exciting as a whole, need more plot surprises or twists, the tone of the flick is cater for older audiences or young audiences who like a bit a serious tone of animation. Again , go see it, you'll enjoy it!
46e57#$sw%%62$45@
We all know what a lazy cuckoo bird does, it lays an egg in other birds' nest and their offspring then push the other eggs and chicks out of it so that they can get all the food, nest space and get raised as an imposter.Meanwhile mummy and daddy cuckoo go off and do their own thing with zero responsibility.Lightyear does exactly that, it's coasts on the Toy Story legacy, feeding off it whilst adding absolutely nothing. It has no reason to exist within that universe.It's an imposter film shamelessly created by Disney to sell more merchandise; it even adds more cute characters such as a robotic cat which I'm sure many kids will be seduced by thereby making their parents ring those tills for Disney till Christmas time.Story wise it's terrible and lazily written, I was bored and clock watching to wait for it to finish. Not many movies have had this affect.Buzz Lightyear is a washed-up loser in this film and evokes none of the heroism the Tim Allen version had. If Andy supposedly saw this in the cinema that made him want a Buzz Lightyear toy according to the start of the film, I would question Andy's taste in hero's!. It's supposed to be his favourite film.The other animation output from Disney of late such as Turning Red, Encanto and Luca have been forgettable as well. Are we witnessing the decline of quality Disney story telling ?? ....it's all pointing to this unfortunately.Soul was probably the last film that I really enjoyed, and repeated viewings still hold up as a fantastic film with a clear message about living your life in a good way and being mindful of the wonderful things life has to offer, even at times you don't always see it. It's also touching and beautifully dreamlike.Lightyear has none of this since the film has no soul, it has been manufactured without any desire to have a philosophical angle to have a message about positivity.The cinema today was muted, I barely heard much laughter from anyone or excitement at what they were watching, which gave me the uncomfortable feeling this has zero magic for cinema goers to go and invest in this. I expect this to drop off very quickly from the box office once word of mouth gets around.This was better off on Disney+

Detective Batman at its peak! Great storyline. Just as dark a universe as we've come to expect from DC. The gloomy, gritty, dark tone of this film is exactly what I wanted. When you think the movie is over, there's more. Beautiful cinematography. Great score.
46e57#$sw%%62$45@
I just got out of The BatmanThis movie really won't be for everyone!! Easily the darkest Batman movie yet. It is gritty, depressing and not a fun movie at all.This isn't your usual comic book movie, it's a detective movie, with more in common with Se7en, than previous Batman movies. The first two thirds of the movie are amazing, at one point I turned to my son and said "This is a masterpiece" everything works and is brilliant, I was 100% enthralled, but boy does it drop the ball in the final act.Of the cast Pattinson is great, Collin Farrell is ok, Zoe Kravitz was fine too, but she has zero chemistry with Pattinson (Keaton and Pfeiffer they are not), Paul Dano though, was incredible, especially in the scene in Arkham, whilst Geoffrey Wright is as great as he always is.On the downside, It does have some pacing issues, and is really too long (though I'm not sure what I'd cut), and I really wasn't keen on the ending (I don't know if it is a comic book storyline they did), as I think the final act really lets the movie down!! It's here, in the final act, that you feel the movies run time!!I was surprised there were only 36 other people in my screening.
46e57#$sw%%62$45@
I have been absolutely fizzing to see 'The Batman' from the day it was announced, but even more so from when I first heard it described as being inspired by 'Se7en' - one of my favourite psychological thrillers of all time. Were we finally going to get the raw and gritty Batman film I'd always dreamed of seeing? We certainly were.Where to begin? The biggest thing that struck me with this film was just how much time we got to spend with Batman, as Batman. There is very little of Bruce Wayne in this movie and I'm absolutely fine with that. The movie is Batman's story and we are with him from start to finish. We even get some narration from him, which I'm not quite sure how I feel about just yet. It was very good narration but I'm not sure he's a character I want it from.The Riddler in this movie is phenomenal. After The Joker in 'The Dark Knight' this is absolutely my second favourite Batman film villain. He was clearly inspired by the Zodiac killer and what an inspired choice. Also the use of the riddles in the film is nothing short of genius. These are very clever riddles and puzzles and make Batman have to do some serious detective work - something I've always wanted more of from him in the previous films.This is my favourite incarnation of Catwoman to date. I haven't loved her character's place in the films in the past. I've found she slows everything down and brings out a dull side of Batman that I haven't enjoyed. In this film though she was used perfectly. She's the love interest and a villain/anti-hero all in one. That is massive because it saves another thing that can often bog down a Batman film - the pointless love interest.The Penguin was probably the one letdown for me. From what I'd seen in the trailer I suspected this may be the case. I'm wondering if they were using this movie as a set-up for him and then in the second film he will evolve and have a lot more to do. In this one though I just found him quite a dull screen-presence.Robert Pattinson as Batman blew me away. He looked great and his voice was perfect. He was extremely intense and very menacing. Even though I knew he was more than capable of playing the role, I think I still needed to see the end product just for confirmation that he had what it takes. He absolutely did and then some.The film has quite a unique feel. There are scenes and sequences in this film that would feel out of place in both Tim Burton's Batman universe and Christopher Nolan's universe. But then there are little aspects from each of their respective films which clearly inspired parts of 'The Batman'. It basically took the best things from each of them and then twisted them into it's own style - while obviously adding a lot of its own stuff also. It's very well done in that sense.The Batmobile in this movie is awesome. There's just no other way to put it. The sound it made and the vibrations it sent through my cinema chair were bone-chilling. The chase sequence in this movie with The Penguin is one of the best I've ever seen.The film is long at just under 3 hours but it really never feels like it. There's a short period in the middle of the movie where everything slows down for a little while. That really is the only flat part of the movie however. The rest happens at a break-neck pace.It's hard to find enough good things to say about this movie. I need to see it again and digest a couple of things for a little longer, but for now I have it firmly sitting in second place behind 'The Dark Knight' in my order of favourite Batman films. 10/10.

Everything about this movie is trying too hard - the over dramatic score, the long shots on characters faces, the overacting, the complex crime story - it all feels like it's trying to get an Oscar in every moment.It's overly long, drawn out, and the story feels like a generic crime saga that has the Batman universe shoehorned into it.This movie is not a masterpiece, but it spends a lot of effort making you think it is!

STAR RATING: ***** Brilliant **** Very Good *** Okay ** Poor * AwfulGotham City is rocked by a series of murders of key political figures, by a sadistic killer calling himself The Riddler (Paul Dano), who holds the city to ransom, revealing darkly guarded secrets and threatening more mayhem until he is stopped. 'The Batman' (Robert Pattinson), the alter ego of millionaire Bruce Wayne, starts an investigation of his own, crossing paths with a woman called Selina Kyle (Zoe Kravitz), who operates as 'Catwoman' and wants to find out what happened to her friend. It sets them both on a collision course with the darkest elements of Gotham's underworld, including notorious gangster 'The Penguin' (an unrecognisable Colin Farrell) and crime boss Carmine Falcone (John Turturro), who may be sitting on a devastating secret that could shatter both their lives.The Batman series must be one of the most enduringly successful franchises in the world of comic book films, appearing in various different incarnations since its original creation. Here, writer/director Matt Reeves delivers a mammoth three hour long interpretation of his own of the character that many seem to be hailing as the best ever. Less doesn't seem to be more anymore, at least not to the cinema artistes, but from this end, all I can see is a film drowning in its own indulgence.Reeves is obviously keen to maintain the bleak, heavy tone established by Christopher Nolan, and so we have a Gotham City with seemingly endless heavy rain, and gloomy skies, set against Pattinson's dark, brooding stare and gravelly voiceovers, set to the background of the emo rock soundtrack. It's just one of many things ripe for parody in a film that takes itself much too seriously and feels almost devoid of any humour and light. Even more overdone is Dano's dark 'Riddler', operating in some garish gimp suit that just looks ridiculous. Thrown in to this is the topical 'social justice' speeches that litter film and TV today, with Kravitz's Catwoman even praising the 'sinister' villain (who we're meant to hate!) at one point, for killing 'all these white privileged a$$holes.' It's just trying to cram a whole load of eggs in to one basket, over ambitious and overlong, and by the time of the main villain's grand 'master plan' at the end, you're too overwhelmed (or bored) to care.Everyone else can think what they like, but personally this is one of the most pretentious Batman's ever, which might have been a bit more bearable if it had just been less self indulgent, or at least had an old fashioned, Lawrence of Arabia style 'intermission' at some point. **

I'm not sure where to begin as I don't generally want to spoil the reveals, but the big twists in the film were very anticlimactic. For 'The Batman'; Matt Reeves seemed to borrow from some of the bigger books such as 'Batman: Year One', 'Hush', and 'Batman: The Long Halloween'. Reeves also leaned heavily onto films such as 'The French Connection', 'Zodiac', and the noir classic 'Chinatown'. The general feel of the movie sought to relate Batman in the detective role that he's famous for in the comics, but unfortunately ignores any attempt at Batman's level of crime &amp; mystery.The acting was really good. There's a great cast of professionals in this film, although Robert Patterson isn't allowed a range of emotion. Bruce Wayne and Batman are completely indistinguishable as the tired emo-kid who walks through life with severe lethargy. Colin Farrell is unrecognizable as the Penguin, and dare I say gave the greatest performance of his life. A large portion of the film is writing out a semi-origin story for Oswald Cobblepot and his rise to become Gotham's crime boss. A lot of the villains are the origin stories here. Batman (the character) is basically introduced the way he is in 'Batman: Year Two' and I thought that was a mistake. Year one of Batman would have been wonderful on screen. The audience seeing Bruce Wayne learning to use fear in his early days would have been a relief to this movie's "Everyone is just scared of him." plot device. Zoe Kravitz's performance as Selena Kyle becoming Cat Woman was under-developed, as she was so much fun to watch in 'The Batman' that I'd like to see this spin-off into a stand-alone Cat Woman release. Jeffery Wright was brilliant (of course) even remaining quiet in the Batman's background he pulled the attention onto himself, mostly because Patterson's portrayal was incredibly stiff. Paul Dano as The Riddler was exactly what I wanted to see in this movie. The character reached a new level of applause as a serial killer, but saddly that part of the plot was put on the back burner for the lackluster crime drama with Carmine Falcone. John Turturro was great as the crime boss Falcone, but the plot focused too long on his side story rather than offering more clues about the killings. It dragged on so long that it bored me completely. I went into 'The Batman' to see him match wits with a clever serial killer, not be re-educated about the connection between Thomas Wayne &amp; Carmine Falcone again.The action sequences with the car chases and the fight choreography seemed old fashioned in a way. I knew before hand that Reeves lifted from some older better known films, but it's as if they dropped the budget on these scenes. Batman racing to catch the Penguin was an old muscle car Batmobile versus (what I'm guessing was) a 1980's Buick. I was laughing at this chase scene... it was presented with such seriousness that maybe if Penguin were in an expensive Italian sports car, I might have enjoyed it. But it was literally a supped-up car desperately trying to out pace my mom's car. The fighting was dull. Hand to hand combat is one of the first things Bruce Wayne learns before donning the cowl. But in this movie Batman is throwing punches a newly trained boxer would scoff at. So much of these scenes were empty and devoid of thrills and chills, that I wondered where the editor was.'The Batman' is simply too long. It's a ridiculous attempt to impress fans of it's own significance. It fails at cohesive story-telling and it basically pats itself on the back throughout the unnecessary musical score. Unlike the Dark Knight before it - I won't watch it again.

The Riddler(Paul Dano, spot-on. How did it take this long for him to get a role like this?) targets public officials, revealing their corruption, and killing them in gruesome fashion(how did this get away with a PG-13 again? Oh, right, as long as you don't show the details, then you can get away with almost anything, by now. Even a barely toned down Jigsaw). In order to stop him, it will be necessary for the Bat and the Cat(with amazing chemistry), together, to stop the rat. Thanks, Matt.I really did not think that we needed yet another film dealing with Bruce Wayne's alter-ego. How about Nightwing? I know it's not likely, but part of me still holds out hope that Grayson will be turned into a feature(if you've never checked out the trailer on YouTube, you're missing out). But somehow, this managed to convince me. Fingers crossed for at least one sequel. Robert Pattinson is incredible here. Seriously, can we just stop freaking out every time the role is recast? The closest we've come to someone who shouldn't be doing it is George Clooney, and it's not like anybody came out of that flick looking good. He took that job after doing From Dusk till Dawn. There was good reason to think that he was going to be badass. Honestly, everyone here gives a strong performance.Something that will definitely appeal to some more than others, is the genre and tone. This is essentially Se7en meets Zodiac. It is not paced like a typical massive blockbuster. While the action is great, especially the martial arts, not to mention that car chase, there's less of it and it is smaller scale than for example the Nolan trilogy(which also has far more escalation). Essentially, this just isn't focused that much on that aspect of the titular icon. And I think we can all agree that we've had some great entries that deliver that. This is more interested in conveying to the audience that there's a reason he's called the world's greatest detective. We've barely seen it outside of the animated ones before, so I'm very happy with that choice by them.In addition to what I've already mentioned, this features some drugs, suggestive material and strong language. I recommend this to any fan of Batman. 9/10.
46e57#$sw%%62$45@
Wasn't a fan of Emo Batman. Sorry Robert Pattinson. Film was just a bit bleh and felt like it was trying too hard to emulate Christopher Nolan and David Fincher. In the end, the mystery was a bit meh and not worth the three hours of what was mostly a run-of-the-mill Superhero film lacking much excitement or thrill. The Riddler was a bit lame too. Forgotten most of the movie and characters already. Underwhelming.5.5/10.

Couldn't even finish this drivel... Firstly : Pattinson is a good actor but doesn't fit Batman's role ...Film is way too long and boring , action is underwhelming ...Overall a big disappointment... Can't recommend it at all...
46e57#$sw%%62$45@
Matt Reeves is not a good director at all-- -he's made one decent film, Rise of the Planet of the Apes, and everything else he's done falls into one of two categories: junk and overrated junk. (Thank goodness The Batman is at least the latter instead of the former). If the director wasn't trying sooooo hard to make the film 'dark' maybe he could have created a new category of just overrated.Firstly, David Fincher himself is bad enough, but David Fincher imitations are even worse. This movie's rote serial-killer plot indulges in every single one of the irritating tropes that Nolan already played around with, most notably the 'but he wanted to be captured!' eye-roller. (Also irritating are Reeves' cheap attempts to desecrate Schubert's music while indulging the trope of the classical music-loving psychopath). Modern culture's obsession with and inadvertent glorification of serial killers is one of my greatest pet peeves---they are just pathetic and boring characters who are all the same. Exchange the Riddler for any of the killers in Fincher's movies and there is basically no difference. And it irritated me to no end how practically every character allowed themselves to fall prey to the Riddler's petty mind games- - if I was there I would promptly tell him to p*ss off and take his stupid video calls elsewhere, even if there was a bomb strapped to my neck.Secondly, the casting is sometimes bizarre. DC has often thrived on unorthodox casting-if they can make Ben Affleck work as Batman anything goes-but they trip up here since we have the high-water mark of the Nolan trilogy to compare it to. Andy Serkis as Alfred? That completely does not work; he just lacks the sophistication of Michael Caine. The new Commissioner Gordon is no Gary Oldman, that's for sure. The Riddler joins the swelling ranks of villains desperately trying to imitate Heath Ledger. (The Riddler from the '66 Batman show was vastly superior--heck, Jim Carrey was). The new Catwoman is alright given the rest of this casting, but is rendered irritating by a script that causes here to carry ON and ON about some friend of hers that ends up killed. Why she's so emotionally attached to this friend is a mystery not even Batman dares solve. The closest thing to a saving grace is the infamously unrecognizable Colin Farrell as the Penguin--- the car chase scene was great even as I kept wondering why none of the vehicles were hydroplaning with something like a full inch of water on the road.Thirdly, the pacing is off. I've seen people accuse Nolan of being portentous, but The Batman takes it to a whole new level with it's bloated runtime. It doesn't even have the quasi-grandeur of the Snyder Cut due to the banal serial killer story which mostly requires people to pop in and out of the Penguin's club ad nauseam. Reeves said that he was supposedly inspired by Alfred Hitchcock, but other than a 'Rear Window' throwback in the opening scene I don't see it. The film is mostly shot like a generic TV procedural filtered through a David Fincher lens, and Reeves completely lacks the morbid playfulness that made Hitchcock so sublime. (Compare any Riddler murder to the one in 'Dial M for Murder', which is one of the more mediocre Hitchcocks). Reeve's sole technique for suspense is to have the Riddler hovering around in the background while an unsuspecting victim putters about.Ugh. If any good this would have become DC's highest grossing film ever. As it is, people will lose interest after a little while and the box office receipts will drop.

I went in with ultra-low expectations because I think Robert Pattison is a god-awful actor and, this film took my expectations and made me promptly realise that, you can always go lower.I'm actually angry I wasted 3 hours of my life (and trust me, every minute of that time was felt).However, let's have some positives: cinematography is great and the music is fantastic. The opening scenes with The Batman made me think, I was going to have another Heath moment and be forced to eat my words because those opening scenes are indeed something special.But then the film gets going. Part "Saw" rip-off and so desperately wants to be "Se7en" in its execution, the story dragged. You don't care about any of the characters and I found myself pining for Clooney and his bat-nipples and Mr. Freeze.What I found really funny though is the producer of this utter mess got in touch with Nolan and warned him, "We're going to make a better Batman than you." No. Just no.Like the last Lord of The Rings film, this has an ending that just keeps on coming. Something wraps up and you start to get ready to leave, the film continues. Something else is wrapped up and you think, "That's it..." and it keeps going.... Something else, and on and on and on...I can see why the guy in the seat nearby racked up a massive line of coke and snorted it midway through (and no, I'm not joking... Welcome to Southampton).With regards to the plank of wood.... Sorry... "Pattison". In the initial scenes I was genuinely excited. Never a fan of his costume before, seeing it here - suddenly I "got it". He proper beats down on someone in a vicious attack. They get back up... In fact, everyone he bat-punches gets back up and just attacks him from behind again. There's no real threat here. When Bale smacked someone down, they stayed dead. But then, when Bale stripped off (same as Affleck), they were built. Robert looked like me and I look like Mr. Burns from The Simpsons. A skeletal mess with no beef there whatsoever. In fact, when Robert bent over in one topless scene, his bones stuck out and I thought wings were going to pop out. But then, why wouldn't they when he infamously said he refused to bulk up for the role (I would have sacked him there and then).His time as Bruce is strictly limited - thank God - so you can't really judge him for that. As Bruce he just stands there and looks confused. As The Batman, by the end he became a parody. His Batman voice changed to the same sound as the joke Batman in the college humour videos (A is for Alfred = genius). When he was mad, it just look like he was pulling a cum-face. And don't even get me started on the Adrian Mole diary keeping that's going in with the voice-over narration.Honestly, with the exception of the opening ten minutes or so, I have never hated a film so much as I did this and given I went in with low expectations, even I am surprised at how fuming I am at myself for wasting my time on it.

Matt Reeves The Batman is a hell of a movie, it is the darkest live action Batman movie ever made, and the longest one too, The Batman fills with a top notch action sequence that not only exciting, but it's cinematic too, the cinematography was just incredible, Michael Giacchino The Batman theme song has just become one of my favorite movie theme song ever, it's enduringly great, the action is perfect itself without the theme but they making it even more perfect with the theme in the background especially when Batman shows up, it really making me hyped more because of that, Colin Farrell transformation is as amazing as his performance as The Penguin, Paul Dano performance is giving me a Heath Ledger Joker vibes but not trying to be Heath Ledger Joker which is still great, Paul Dano The Riddler is still a terrifying and a very disturbing villain, Zoe Kravits performances as Catwoman was amazing though she is not as wild as Michelle Pfeiffer in Batman Returns but boy did her gesture and look is as wild as Michelle Pfeiffer, and the Catwoman fighting sequence is definitely a win for Zoe and i did still like her a lot in here, and in the end we got The Batman himself, Robert Pattinson, all i can say about him as The Batman is that i hope everybody is starting to know him as the guy who play The Batman which is a really good movie and not the guy who play in the horrible Twilight film anymore because he is indeed an awesome Batman, now he was become my second favorite Batman next to Christian Bale in number one still, the story of The Batman itself is great, and my only problem with the movie is that there is quite a lot of particular scene that for me are just very slow or too slow, it's not boring but i feel like they can make it a little bit faster, if it's only one or two or three scene i probably still can forgive it but unfortunately it happens more than that, but at in the end The Batman is still a hell of a great movie, it's still amazing and it's still incredible, i was impress by most of the thing that happens, i was excited, i was hyped, i was stunt by all the amazing thing that they've done, The Batman is fire!!!.

I will say I liked the story, but the long dragged out and slowly paced near 3 hours was ridiculous. You could watch this at 1.5x speed and it would be more enjoyable. This needed at least 20 mins cut out and much faster storytelling. And the constant whisper dialogue in most of the film became annoying really fast.I do like Pattinson as an actor, but not as Batman in this one. He wasn't convincing and his monotonic whispering dialogue and Emo demeanor was very lackluster to the point of cringeworthy. And that's him both as Batman and even more so as Bruce Wayne.And what's with Colin Farrell being cast with all these prosthetics to play the Penguin? Was every other actor that naturally has that character's look unavailable? It's not like Farrell has a particular set of Penguin skills lol. Casting Farrell as Batman and Pattinson as Penguin, now that would've worked much better imo.I'm also a big fan of Westworld's Jeffrey Wright, but here again, he was very unconvincing as Gordon, especially when he also had that monotonic whispering Emo demeanor. I get that director and joint writer Reeves was going for that dark lonely dreary theme, but instead, the characters looked bored and inexperienced actors with sore throats.The only one that nailed their character perfectly was the lovely and beautiful Kravitz, who stole the entire show. I would've rather watched a 4+ hour movie with just her as Catwoman.All the Affleck, Keaton, Bale, Kilmer and even Clooney Batman characters were much more convincing, as well as having more and better "keep you awake" action in said films.Sadly, this one is a generous yet disappointing 6/10 from me.

To preface this review I will say when watching this in the cinemas, many people walked out. I was looking over my shoulder to see of anyone else was laughing at what cringe this movie delivers.The actors in this were one of the highlights excluding the villain (the riddler) and the Batman. Penguin was by far the coolest and best actor. Honestly a good fellas type character. All other supporting actors were also quite good. I however think Robert pattinson a horrible pick for Batman. The whole time he seems like a really awkward and sad goth kid, I was half expecting him to say "gosh get outta my room". Absolutely trash acting The riddler was even worse! He was the major cringe factor in this movie with awful and dorky video calls where he is super non intimidating and laughable. His video calls reminded me of the horror films my 15 year old class mates had made in high school, their budgets were $0.The relationship between the Batman and cat woman was my only other plus in this movie. The romance was quite sweet and had a lot of tension. They rode around In their awesome motorcycles just roaring through the town it was really cute.The bat mobile was pretty awesome but definitely very weird for a Batman film. The old classic camaro was a little spine chilling not gonna lie.Now to answer everyone's questions I do think Robert pattinson was a terrible choice for Batman for a few reasons. At first I had no qualms but watching the film made me believe he was a bad and cringey actor for the role, he just isn't a badass over masculine kinda guy, like at all. He seems awkward and it shows. His voice wasn't that great, his body was not very big nor muscular like many other batmans, heck even the joker is ripped in suicide squad. The guy is 6ft exactly but his frame is tiny and it shows next to bigger actors. The story was God awful without spoiling pretty much lots of people die, bombs go off and some personal people Batman knows get injured. Then Batman goes welp I can't be in 3 places at once I'm only human. And proceeds to get ko'd twice throughout the movie and punched lots during fights. He is by far the worst and weakest looking Batman with the worst actor to have played him. The cinematography was good and the horror feeling this brings is good but everything else was just so horrible. Did I mention this film is 3 hours long to have a crap middle and end? Well know I know!. Wow I couldn't wait for thr 3 hours to end and multiple people walked out before the film was half finished. Definitely wouldn't reccomend this garbage piece of cinema. 2/10 for me.

Robert P is a terrible Batman. Absolutely no Bat-charisma at all. The Riddler character is a complete bore! I hated all of this film. I certainly do not understand the good reviews. It's not close to the Dark Knight caliber. Please do not make a sequel.

The headline can be taken two ways. If you remove any hype or expectations, saying it's a good movie is positive. But if you are hoping for an amazing new Batman iteration, good means it wasn't great, let alone amazing.This review will come off as negative but I did enjoy it. I love the tone. It's super dark and grounded in reality, even more than the Nolan trilogy. And it feels true to the character. Zoe Kravitz and Jeffrey Wright are great casting choices. It's a mostly well-made film and a good addition to the franchise. And the Bat suit looks awesome.At the same time, nothing about this movie wowed me. I did not connect with the characters, especially the villain. The relationships seem undeveloped and not organic. I was not nearly as emotionally invested in the story as I should have been. It mostly feels surface level.If you're a huge Batman fan, I think you will really enjoy it. But as a movie, I don't think it fires on all cylinders. The Nolan trilogy still reigns supreme.

I never thought that I would view a worse DC movie than Catwoman or the Harley Quinn movie. I was sorely mistaken. The Batman by far is the absolute biggest mistake in any comic book adaptation. The casting was wrong - there was not one cast member who had a good performance; the script was pitiful - it was too long and all over the place; the direction was terrible and the editing was questionable.Nothing was a positive about this film except the end credits where you could escape the misery.
46e57#$sw%%62$45@
What were Reeves and Craig thinking? I mean, wasn't the Douglas Nolan Bat-trilogy with Christian Bale dark and pessimistic enough? Did they have to try and top that by painting Bruce Wayne's parents as not being so spotless? And what was with the nearly three-hour running time?Between those two factors, this movie felt more like the love child of "Gone With The Wind" and Joaquin Phoenix's Joker flick. Which is most definitely _not_ a good thing! The only reason I give this two stars, instead of one, is because of the unexpected (but surprisingly effective) blending of the Riddler with Hush.Well, that, and the casting of Jeffrey Wright...who does a commendable job as Jim Gordon.

I'll say it started pretty good and I liked the cinematography. But I thought it dragged on, and the social commentary on destroying "white privileged men" was ironic as that's what Batman is- a privileged white rich guy who can mascarade as a vigilante because he's rich and has all the free time to do so; and we feel for him because boo boo he's an orphan. This was a very obvious "woke" fest. I like the diversity but it's when they blatantly shove rhetoric down your throat that it starts to become cringey. Pattinson was so sleepy, like Joe Biden in a Batman suit sleepy. Joker is my favorite movie of all time and I feel like they tried to go for that but it just had too many missteps. I did like Farrell as the Penguin and the Riddler was basically Dexter the Anti-hero...

Right from the 1st leaked screenshots I had doubts about this movie, wasn't bothered by the fact Robbie Pattinson was playing the main man, moody, morose, silent, he had all the things necessary to portray the brooding Batman, unfortunately he had no screen presence, the Batman's mere look should strike fear, Pattinsons didn't, had the resounding thumps of his Jack boots not been amplified to sound like a herd of elephants it would've been easy for him to go unnoticed among the throngs of police officers &amp; various characters.The only scene that attempted to inject any excitement was the "budget Batmobile" chase scene, overly long, quite pointless &amp; shockingly silly and far far too loud, another problem with this movie, whereas the musical score was for the most part the best thing about this movie it's actual sound was one of the worst, every screech, scream and gunshot was turned up to maximum, deafening the audience.Of course the real villain of this movie is the story or more precisely its lack of one, yes we're introduced to "the Penguin" an overweight balding scar faced slob that screams more sleazy pervert than villain &amp; a complete waste of use of the character then its "the Riddler" a bespectacled "youtuber" in what's best described as a gimp costume, a character with no special talents yet is somehow able to enter unseen an exclusive apartment and commit murder, a locked vehicle to over power it's driver and enter unseen a police gym and over power the cheif of police and kidnap him and all the while screeching like a banshee on video &amp; facetime.The films runtime is far too long telling a story that is uninteresting and ultimately very boring, there are no heroic deeds performed no good guy to root for.The time line for this movie becomes apparent from the diary kept by Bruce Wayne and various TV news broadcasts, this is year two in the career of the Batman yet he isn't the vigilante that's feared by the criminal underground yet he's hated by the police force, with no context to work from of his past deeds as a vigilante its very confusing.Quite simply this isn't a movie about Batman , Pattinson could have played the character without the costume and the movie would have still been the same, a very boring lacklustre detective story.Zoe Kravitz plays Catwoman, a character completely different to the Halle Berry version but played equally as badly.Put simply this movie ranks worse Batman movie behind the awful Batman and Robin, as the caped crusader Pattinson isn't a patch on Keaton, Kilmer, Bale or even Afflek.I can only imagine Warner Bros/DC wanted to emulate the profits they raked in from "The Joker" so decided to give Batman the same treatment but where "Joker" stripped away everything and concentrated on the character "The Batman" strips away everything about the character and concentrates on everything else, the sets, cinematography and secondary characters are fine tuned and highly detailed whereas Batman is reduced to a pair of "Jack boots" clumping through the movie.By the end of Matt Reeves "The Batman" I felt I knew a little about what it was like to be in a hostage situation, the elation I felt at the ending of the movie gave newly found strength to my numbed legs allowing me to bound out from the cinema seat seeking the freedom of the evening air, it was a wonderful experience, something I sadly can't say about the movie.Nolans trilogy is still the best, he gave the character a begging a middle and an end and he did it with style all the while telling a complex and interesting story about complex and interesting characters, Matt Reeves fails abysmally with "The Batman" choosing to emulate scenes from past Batman movies rather than creating something new and unseen, from Keatons Bruce Wayne to Bales Dark Knight it's all there easily recognised.If this is Reeves idea of re-booting the character for a new generation then it was a pointless endeavour, the new generation hasn't the need or interest for it, they certainly don't have the patience to sit through 3 hours of it.The movie is about the beginning of Batman's career when he is young, full of the energy necessary to fight the criminals and crime of Gotham city, Pattinsons "Batman" meanders through the movie as if he were a zombie looking disinterested and deflated, this is not a superhero movie nor a movie about a hero, it should not be a movie at all.

I wanted to love this movie. I would have settled for hating it. Instead, I was bored for three hours.The movie is a sloppy buffet of darkness, rain, gloom, unnecessary narration, wooden acting, absurd dialogue, pointless characters, canyon-wide plot-holes, unresolved story arcs, flaccid motivation for the bad guys, hyper-fast cuts, eye-rolling detective work, conventionally choreographed fight scenes, a cinematic emo aesthetic, a pseudo-Gothic mis en scene, a complete lack of humor or light-hearted moments of any kind, no soul in the acting, unsophisticated writing, timid directing, and a fully-checked list of boxes from the superhero / vigilante cliche playbook.This is a partial list of my complaints. (If pressed, I could probably find a handful of good things to say, but they'd be far too inconsequential to bail this movie out of the depths of Meh.)Having grown up on Adam West's Batman, I've lived through the campiness, the avant-garde, the silly, the surreal, and the downright brilliant (I'm looking at you Dark Knight). There have been Batman movies I've loved and ones I've hated. There are some Batman movies my family and I quote and admire and others we make fun of while we re-watch them to revel in their captivating absurdity. This is the first Batman iteration where I was disappointed, bordering on offended at the completely pedestrian effort and the unimaginative, forgettable final product.If you're under thirteen years old, a sucker for three hours of tedious brooding, and if you don't have a bone-deep familiarity with and love of the genre, you *might* enjoy this. Otherwise, if you're a superhero fan and a true movie lover, please please please steer clear of this one!

Wonderfly shot. Love the serial killer type approach. Matt Reeves never disappoints with choice of color, tone and over all cinematography.That being said, the story wasnt that interesting to be honest. Nothing was surprising or intriguing and because of that, the result was a poor nonthreatening antagonistAs for character casting, Zoe Kravitz is probably the worst Catwoman. Not one Catwoman characteristic was displayed. Might as well get anyone to play Catwoman. Jeffrey Wright was surprisingly a good Jim Gordan although i have no idea when Batman had a partner lol. John Turturro just looks too goofy to pull off as some crazy mob boss/supporting antagonist. Colin Farrell was amazing 👊The greatest detective/tactician failed to do any real detective work. Solved a few riddles and off we go. Bale still #1All in all great production, good acting (especially from Pattison and Farrell). Would I recommend watching it? Yea i guess. A second time... probably not.

For better or worse (mostly better), The Batman is when he's detective first, superhero second. A bleak yet thrilling noir but also with a glimpse of exhilarating hope. It doesn't hurt really if we're having a new Batman film, especially if it took a riveting route like this. Pattinson and Kravitz were explosive together.

The Batman (2022) is a movie my wife and I caught an advanced screening of last night. The storyline follows Gotham shortly after "The Batman" has emerged and established himself in the streets. A serial killer known as The Riddler starts a killing spree of everyone influential within Gotham's hierarchy until Bruce Wayne in inevitably the target. How are all of these people tied together and can Batman tie the pieces together before Wayne is the next victim?This movie is directed by Matt Reeves (Cloverfield) and stars Robert Pattinson (Twilight), Zoë Kravitz (Kimi), Colin Farrell (Total Recall), Paul Dano (There Will be Blood), John Turturro (Do the Right Thing), Peter Sarsgaard (Garden State), Andy Serkis (Lord of the Rings), Jeffrey Wright (Shaft) and Barry Keoghan (Eternals).The storyline, look and feel of this movie is an A+. The characters are perfectly cast and well executed. Farrell, Dano and Kravitz were a 10/10.This movie does a fantastic job of depicting the Batman universe with the appropriate grit and feel and the lighting and cinematography is excellent. This also did a good job of creating various potential spinoffs with some subtle references within the storyline and at the end. This has a very good Jeph Loeb comics feel to it and does a good job delivering the "Detective" elements of Batman. The violence was also brilliant and very well done. I will say this did not need to be 3-hours and there are an abundance of scenes that could have been better edited. This film likely should have been a hair under 2 and a half hours.Overall this is a magnificent addition to the super hero genre and an absolute must see for Batman fans. I would score this a 7.5- 8/10 and strongly recommend it.

THE BATMAN (2022) *** Robert Pattinson, Zoe Kravitz, Jeffrey Wright, Colin Farrell, Paul Dano, John Turturro, Andy Serkis, Peter Sarsgaard. Filmmaker Matt Reeves pulls out all the stops in this even darker adaptation of the Bob Kane comic book hero with Pattinson standing tall and brooding as Bruce Wayne employing vigilante style justice as The Caped Cursader while Gotham quakes under the siege of the homicidal Riddler (Dano affectively disturbing) and gaining an unlikely ally in Selina Kyle (ass-kicking Kravitz in pre-Catwoman mode). Arresting visuals thanks in large part to ace cinematography by Greig Fraser and James Chinlund's production design all aided by the foreboding score by Michael Giacchino full of bombast and dread. Farrell, under a ton of unrecognizable prosthetics, has a field day in getting in touch with his inner Robert De Niro as The Penguin. By all means see it in IMAX!

"I see what you're going for, but it's not really working." This was my feeling numerous times during this movie. So many things feel off or ingenuine. Almost like it's a "factory-made" movie rather than something hand-crafted.I didn't care about the characters. There are lots of stupid moments and things that make you raise an eyebrow. The treasure hunting stuff feels so random like they are making it up on the spot. The comedy isn't terrible, it made me smirk a bunch of times. But I don't think I laughed one single time. And a few of the jokes are super cringe-y.The action is alright. I like crazy, outrageous action movies. But none of scenes impressed me. I think part of it is not caring about the characters, which drains the tension. And the fight scenes are once again, for the millionth time, filled with quick-cuts and close-ups so you can't see. When will they learn?I really wish movies would go for the R rating more often. But if you're going to go with PG-13, please stop trying to show (but not show) things that should be in a rated R movie. For example, if someone's throat is slit, don't blatantly cut away at the last second. And then continue to show that person multiple times, with ZERO blood coming out. It makes the movie feel amateur.On four occasions I thought to myself, "Look, Tom Holland is Spider-Man-ing." And it's not because I can't see the actor in any other role. He is very different in Cherry. But things he said sounded exactly like something Peter Parker would say, and things he did looked exactly like Spider-Man would do them. At one point I wondered if they were doing it on purpose. Odd. (1 viewing, opening night IMAX 2/17/2022)

Ideal for fans of Tom Holland and devil-may-care treasure hunts, "Uncharted" is a solid action movie with crazy stunts, beautiful locations and surprising star power. It's a good reason to leave the house for that big-screen spectacle that we all live for. If you've never owned a Playstation, that's really all you need to have a good time.. . .But sweet merciful Jesus, this is not an Uncharted movie and that is a torpedo that sinks the whole thing. Because to have that, you need Drake and Sully, and both Holland and Mark Wahlberg are way off; they're not even close. They don't look like these characters and they don't sound like them, despite the mid-credits afterthought of a scene that's supposed to satisfy this requirement.And as a result, I have to admit, I was bored to tears. To the movie's credit, it picks up considerably in the third act, and even goes nuts in the set piece department (that airlift scene was pretty cool). But to make us wait ninety-odd minutes for Drake to even pick up a gun is ridiculous.I admit personal bias in the strongest sense; this series of games makes my desert-island list, no question, and I wanted to be surprised by this. It just didn't happen, and I couldn't make these actors fit these characters. As it stands, that Nathan Fillion fan film from a few years back (I'm serious, go watch it) still reigns supreme. I try to be a movie-goer that steers clear of fanboyism, but it didn't work here. And it was not fun.

Obvious cgi, plot holes, and lack of character depth made uncharted fall in the kind of lame category. Some funny moments between Wahlberg and Holland and decent sets. It was just too unbelievable.
46e57#$sw%%62$45@
I'm being really generous with 6 stars, because this movie is neither really funny, nor really exciting.Not any good? The CGI effects are pretty special, but personally I often get bored when the CGI effects are the only thing keeping a movie afloat. And there are basically only 2 CGI spectacle scenes that are noteworthy and even those I found somewhat overkill and boring.Let's forget about the story. This is merely another adventure movie, like the Pirates of the Carribean meets National Treasure. It'll do if there is nothing else to watch, but dont expect any originality, dont expect many laughs and dont expect much thrillling action either...

After many years we finally have an Uncharted film, this film is based on the really popular video game franchise and today I have watched it and here is my review for it. The premise of the film sees a young man getting recruited to go on a hunt for a long lost treasure.Main Character
Tom Holland plays Nathan Drake and I can't help myself he is really entertaining to watch and I think this is just because of Holland's natural charm and charisma manages to drag him through. But the issue is that he just isn't what I wanted from Nathan Drake as a character, he is nothing like his video game counterpart and that is a big shame. I was watching the film and all I saw was Peter Parker just without his Spider-Man costume. Hopefully, this is only because this film came out just after Spider-Man: No Way Home but I do worry that Holland might become typecast and a one trick pony.Supporting Characters
Mark Wahlberg plays Sully and it is a similar story to our main character. He has plenty of natural charisma to him and his chemistry with Holland is really good and at least there is some sort of character development on show. But I felt like it was Mark Wahlberg walking around and the character of Sully from the video games and that was the issue for me, he is just the same as he is in every other film and this is a slight shame for me. Sophia Ali plays Chloe and I actually quite liked her, maybe because she was the one performer I didn't recognise made her feel like an actual character and somebody who was actually interesting to watch. The bad guys didn't work though, Antonio Banderas is here but he is just your generic villain and I don't know when but it seems like when a European bad guy is needed then he is the one cast and it just didn't work here. Tai Gabrielle is better as a villain but she isn't that great either but was at least a physical enemy to Drake.Story
The story did a pretty good job of showing a young Nathan Drake starting his career and leading us on a fun adventure story across the globe that had shades of Indiana Jones to it. There is some sort of character development attempted and the actors seemed like they were having fun here. But there is a lack of depth and direction for the overall plot of the film. I think it could needed to pace itself a bit better and focus on the characters a bit more and give the villains way better motivations.Script
The film actually has a surprising amount of humour to it and I was chuckling my way through most of the film, mixed with a bit of heart made this alright. But there isn't enough here, I didn't care about the characters enough and sometimes it felt like the film relied on its star power instead of actually crafting these better written heroes and villains.Style
The style has some really good action scenes, including the crazy cargo plane scene that was in all of the trailers. The film is quite relentless too, the adventure moves at a pretty break neck pace which is good but it also harms the characterisation and plot of the film. It was a fun action film without the depth needed to become a good film.Overall
Overall, Uncharted is a pretty average adventure film. There is some good here for sure and Sony are hoping to make this a franchise but it doesn't do enough for me to get me excited for that or recommend this for a watch.Rating - 5/10.

Well, oddly enough then I actually never have played the games, but I am well familiar with them and the concept that is "Uncharted". So I sort of knew what I was in for here, as I sat down to watch the 2022 movie "Uncharted" from writers Rafe Judkins, Art Marcum, Amy Hennig, Jon Hanley Rosenberg, Matt Holloway and Mark D. Walker.And just as expected, then director Ruben Fleischer definitely delivered a wholesome and spot on action adventure that delivers a fast-paced adventure that will make the boy-that-never-wants-to-grow-up-in-us-all more than happy. The storyline in "Uncharted" was a great mixture of fast-paced action, great adventure much in the likes of "Indiana Jones", treasure hunting and good characters. So yeah, chances are great that there is something for just about everyone in the audience here.The movie stars Tom Holland and Mark Wahlberg, whom actually carries the movie quite well together. But the movie also have the likes of Antonio Banderas, Sophia Ali, Tati Gabrielle and Steven Waddington on the cast list.I was more than genuinely entertained by this action adventure, and it certainly is a franchise that could spawn more movies to sequel this one. I had heard some reviewer mention that "Uncharted" was just a popcorn munchin movie that required no thinking of any kind. But I found "Uncharted" to be more than just a lean-back-and-munch-on-the-popcorn type of movie, luckily. If you enjoyed the "Indiana Jones" movies, then you will certainly also enjoy "Uncharted".As for realism, well just neatly wrap that notion in a small wrapping and place it on the shelf for the nearly two hours that "Uncharted" plays. This movie is all about entertainment, surprise, surprise.My rating of "Uncharted" lands on a seven out of ten stars.

Dialogues were outrageously cheesy and poorly written. Rafe Lee Judkins, Art Marcum and Matt Holloway need to pack their bags and leave Hollywood ASAP, maybe they can invite Ruben Fleischer too.Tom Holland in his Peter Parker era. It's the same performance, nothing unique or original.Just like Fleischer's previous films, this too muddled in questionable performances and lack of character development and it seems like they didn't held an audition for the supporting cast, studio executives just picked some random actors from nowhere. None of the cast members had any kind of chemistry or acting prowess to be in a $120 million production.I don't know if its an inside joke or an accidental coincidence, there's literally a dialogue from Sully that says "Wow, I'm really losing my touch".Marky Mark in his Bruce Willis era.

There's nothing to see here that is fun, turn away, lock the door, make a run; the CGI's poor, acting's amateur, all threads have frayed apart, become unspun.... and to think this might only be part 1!

I actually enjoyed this movie. But after hearing fans of the game talking about the weird casting. I have to take a couple of points off. I mean, you should always try to keep the fans happy. As well as bringing in newcomers.So Tom Holland and Mark Wahlberg are totally wrong choises for these characters here. Holland in particular is really just the same as he is in Spiderman, and that's maybe what the money people wanted.Outside of the actors though, I was expecting this to be a CGI heavy mess. And though there is alot of CGI in its later parts. I still liked the action in the movie. The plane scene does feel like it belongs more in a game. But some of the realistic action, and the over the top finale were well done. You'll be entertained if you have no interest in the games I guess.

36/100Uncharted is Sony's latest attempt to fit an acclaimed franchise with 42 hours of content and story into just 2... Make your own judgment from that.It's funny to think that, no matter how hard you try, these days you cannot adapt a video game into a film, and vice versa. While one tries to be as efficient as possible with his limited time, the other can pack as much information as it can in order to become more extensive or ambitious.This indicates that, even if someone has the courage to adapt something like the Uncharted series to the big screen, whether they wanted to or not, they must summarize, or flatly ignore, certain plot points to prioritize others. The problem is that this selection process has such a complex naturalness that, with a single mistake, it can feel like the film is trying to contextualize as much as it can, ignoring not to feel overwhelming.Even if that is your purpose, you have to be subtle. Uncharted binned that advice completely.From European villains to straight up pirate ships, Uncharted feels like one of the least ambitious popcorn flicks I've come across in quite some time.The plot seems to have been invented while the filming process of the film was being executed, which would not surprise me at this point if it were true, while clinging to the mediocrity of the actors' work. The same ones who clearly did not want to be part of the film in the first place.

I've heard dozens of people compare this to Indiana Jones. I think a more apt comparison would include the Da Vinci Code in the conversation. Yes, it has some of the fun adventure set-pieces we expect; the helicopter-ship fight &amp; hanging-out-of-plane scenes are mindlessly well-executed cinematic absurdity. Sadly, it's made disposable by colorless characters &amp; a parade of explorer movie cliches &amp; MacGuffins that even a long-haired Hanks (much less the miscast Wahlberg/Holland duo) couldn't make work.

The Uncharted video game franchise is my favourite series of games ever made. I thought I should get that out of the way before diving into my review. Upon the countless storylines I'm sure they went over and numerous directors leaving the project before settling on Ruben Fleischer, I was worried, but still very excited to see these characters on the big screen. This will also be a completely unbiased review because I can't even compare it to the games. Too many things have been changed to really compare it. With all of that said, let's dive in.The story begins with young Nathan Drake, a bartender who had one day planned on finding treasure with his brother Sam. After the disappearance of his brother, he never felt the need to get back into the game. When Victor Sullivan (Sully) appears after his shift one night, he brings up the past, saying that he worked with his brother Sam. This instantly makes Nathan want to be a part of this story and the two of them form a bond. These two believe that a fortune left behind by Ferdinand Magellan over 500 years ago is still sitting somewhere in the world. They take this journey together, but they're not the only ones after this treasure, which leads to a lot of predictability as well.When I first heard that Tom Holland was cast to play Nathan Drake and Mark Wahlberg would be playing Sully, I, like many other fans, was left scratching my head. It was clear that they wanted to start these characters younger than they were in the game in order to build a long-running franchise, but it just didn't seem right. Again, I'm wasn't about to let my love of the games sway me in any direction though. I'm a huge fan of both Holland and Wahlberg, so here's the catch-22 happening in my head. Did I enjoy this movie overall and did I enjoy these two in their respective roles? I absolutely did! Do I still feel that it was a little miscast and that they should've been older? I absolutely do! For both of those reasons and for a few negatives I'm about to get into, I believe Uncharted is an okay, entertaining movie for the most part.Ruben Fleischer has been a very hit-or-miss director for me, directing both Zombieland films, which I think are great, as well as Venom, which I had some fun with, but he has also done some pretty bad films in Gangster Squad and 30 Minutes or Less. His films always have a very clean look to them and a silly/fun tone. I was worried that tone wouldn't fit an Uncharted movie and I do feel that way after having seen the film as well. Bright and colourful (other than landscapes around them) is not how I ever saw an Uncharted movie looking, but again, it was adapted and I'm not going to complain about the look. What I feel is the weakest aspect of this film is the fact that there's absolutely no grit. Nobody is ever dirty, there's barely any blood, and it never feels like stakes are high because these characters can go through a lot without a scratch.Overall, I probably have more to critique than praise when talking about Uncharted, but that's just because the Screenplay felt like it was hitting random bullet points instead of fleshing out the world they're living in. It never felt lived-in. Still, I love the cast (including Antonio Banderas and Sophia Ali as well), the banter between Nathan and Sully was fun, the action is cool, and I left the theatre feeling positive enough about the film that I would love to see them continue. I will gladly go back for a sequel, but I just hope they evolve these characters more and get down to a grittier, dirtier story. Yes, the point of Uncharted is to have fun and tell a great story, but I felt the story was a little hollow here. I think it's a movie worth seeing and I recommend it because I think there is potential for so much better in the future. This film is just okay overall, but the groundwork has now been laid for something even better.

Let's keep it real: this is as losely put together as is possible. The movie tries to incorporate as many references to the games as it can, while covering as much ground as it can. Some might even say it takes on too much ... I am not one of those people. Some may be dissapointed, because they expected something ... that was sort of a copy of the games - which would not make much sense in my book to be honest.Or you may not like the casting. Holland aside, it is Wahlberg who seems missplaced as Sully. I reckon since he was considered for the Nathan Drake part (which I guess tells you how long this must have been in development, no offense), they thought "well at least he can play this mentor role".Well Mentor may be stretching it a bit .. but you get where I am going with this. Drakes and Sullys relationship is explored or rather established in a different light and tone ... which you'll either find fine or disturbing I guess. Also Holland still seems so incredibly young you may feel he's too young ... again, you have to get over certain things.There's enough entertainment and action in this to keep you on the edge of your seat. Solid stunts and digital effects work. Not all twists work, but even the weird choice for Wahlberg as Sully actually can work for the viewer (again: suspension of disbelief) ... one thing is for sure: the chemistry between the two leads is incredible! Try to enjoy this for what it is .. even if you are a hardcore fan of the games ... or not.

It's so dull, there's no real action, no fights or violence and the supposed lead as in the video games is a weak side piece. This is not a hood reimagining.I like wahlberg he was fine, about the only character that worked except the female explorer. He over-shone Holland to the point it was pretty embarrassing for the guy.I thought I was a Holland fan but I've fast realised anything that isn't Spider-Man that he's done has been literally abysmal, that mute, dream power mess and various other awful messes he's been in, fast going off him, looks to young to be a believable badass or heart throb, has no presence, no authority and delivers the lines exactly like spider man, that cheeky, childish dialogue, pretty one dimensional. He is no leading man, awfully wrong for the role, see why you got him as he's popular but he just played it wrong and just looked like a child. Poor, it may have actually worked better swapping mark and Tom. Toms performance was pretty bad.There's just no action, boring story and set pieces from a video game, it's lazy, uneventful, woke weak nonsense, it's literally aimed at little kids, there's no actual adult action , the fight scenes are so basic and non violent.The effects were average, yeah looked nice but just didn't work for me, rest of the characters were meh, the tease with the guy from GOT, does nothing for me and the moustache line was awful. That villain Braddock was so unbelievable in her role, women can be badass villains but this woman was weak, cool look but not a great acting performance or character.Weak, lazy and trying to get all ages it's alienated uncharted fans, this will never be a successful film franchise in this state.

Uncharted had a feel that it was based on something else, but I was thinking like a book or something. I'm guessing sense Playstation produced this than that means it actually based on a game.Can't tell you if it's true to the material, all I can tell you is that I liked it.It's an action-adventure flick that's fun and exciting.Tom Holland and Mark Walberg made a decent team for me. It's funny, I could not see either or doing the movie by themselves, but they make a lot of sense together.Can't come up with much to say about it, except that it was as good as I thought it would be. It not going to change lives and it's in no way bad movie, and in all the ways its worth seeing.

As video games continue to rise in popular culture, it's only natural that they should receive more film adaptations. Uncharted, which is one of the most popular franchises under the PlayStation brand, is very cinematic in its own right. Inspired by adventure films like Indiana Jones, the games are practically interactive movies themselves. For this, the ideal is to make a movie that appeals both to general audiences and to fans of the series. Uncharted is a movie that succeeds to a certain extent to the former and fails tremendously in the latter. The movie throws the canon of the games out the window, although it does directly adapt some scenes from the games. It takes the auction house scene from Uncharted 4, the plane scene from Uncharted 3, the whole arc with Sam from 4.As an adventure movie, it's nothing special, but nothing too terrible. If you know nothing about the source material, you may even find yourself enjoying it. It's got some fun moments in it. It's got a heist at an auction house, ancient puzzles in a Gothic church, and plenty of action in the sky. Some of these action scenes really do capture the spirit of adventure movies, which is always great fun. While some of them are lifted right from the games, they do play out well for what they're worth. There are moments when the adventure spirit kicks in, and that is welcome. Ancient mysteries and action scenes are always fun. The main theme from the games appears, which was a nice addition.As an adaptation of the games, it falls massively short. The casting is horrendous. Tom Holland is way too young to play Nathan Drake, as he lacks the suave personality that makes Drake who he is. Nathan's personality is completely absent in this character. Drake's movie personality feels more like MCU Spider-Man than the Nathan Drake in the games. This character on the screen is not Nathan Drake. Mark Wahlberg as Sully is an equally bad casting. While it's unlikely that anyone on this cast played the games, this is just Marky Mark, with no resemblance to Sully whatsoever. The lack of the moustache hurts, but there's nothing at all to signify that this is supposed to be Sully. Sully in the games is a classic "scoundrel with a heart of gold." This guy is just a scoundrel. Wahlberg is also way too young to play Sully. Chloe was probably the closest to being like the games, but that's not saying much. She at least looks the part, which is more than what the others have going for them. She does the classic double agent thing from the games as well, which is one of the few things they got right. Elena is not in it at all, which was disappointing. The villains were bland, nothing more to say about them, other than that they squandered Antonio Banderas (although in fairness, most of the villains in the games are bland too). There's also a really awesome cameo from Nolan North, which was probably the best scene in the entire movie.If this movie wasn't connected at all to the Uncharted games, it would be a harmless action adventure movie that would have some similarities to the games, like how the games are inspired by adventure movies. By attaching it to the Uncharted franchise, it puts the expectation that it's going to be something like the games. While there are snippets of the games here and there, it's simply not enough. This does not feel like an Uncharted movie.By the way, the PlayStation Studios logo, with Nathan Drake, Kratos and Atreus (boy), Jin Sakai, Joel and Ellie, Aloy, and Sackboy was awesome. I guess we'll be seeing that on the upcoming Last of Us and Ghost of Tsushima adaptations.

Nate and his older brother Sam, orphans, try to steal a valuable map which, Sam believes, gives clues to the whereabouts of hidden gold from Magellan's voyage around the world. When they are caught, Samm escapes and sends Nate postcards from around the world before suddenly vanishing. Over a decade later, Nate is approached by Sully to assist him in stealing an artefact which may lead to further clues in the treasure hunt. What follows is duplicity, double-dealing, danger, globetrotting, beautiful deadly women, rich deadly men, henchmen, underground cellars and tunnels, dangling from planes and helicopters, and a lot of lighthearted banter. Plus Nate finds out what happened to Sam.This action adventure movie is big dumb fun from start to finish. The plot is fun and the action is eyecatching, if often so improbable as to inspire disbelief.Tom Holland shows that he can anchor a movie, albeit he has sterling support from Mark Wahlberg. Both play familiar character (as does Antonio Banderas), but they play them well. A sequel is promised - twice! - at the end, and I hope it happens, because I enjoyed spending time with these characters.

And the 'we don't have a clue how to translate video games into movies' train departs w/Sony's belated adaptation of the popular videogame series. Never having played the games (even though I own them, something to do during my retirement years I figure!) but having seen footage &amp; knowing the fanbase was lobbying for Nathan Fillion (of Firefly fame) to be cast as Nathan Drake, we now have our favorite current webslinger, Tom Holland, playing a younger version of him who is seduced by a worldly fortune hunter, played by Mark Wahlberg (who ironically was slated to play Drake when his go to guy David O. Russell was attached to the project) who go after some famed treasure whose clues (similar to clues seen in The DaVinci Code or National Treasure which beg the viewer's credulity in the over-complicated breadcrumbs left behind by the treasure hoarders) lead to hidden gold w/the requisite mustache twirling baddie, here played by Oscar nominee Antonio Banderas &amp; his henchperson (who was once Wahlberg's protégé/partner), played by the Chilling Adventures of Sabrina's Tati Gabrielle foiling Holland/Wahlberg's plans at every turn. Another partner, played by Sophia Ali, is in the mix as well but her distrust of her partners (something that after a while starts to grate on the viewer, if you don't trust them...leave!) soon upsets the flow of things. W/an overall sense of wrong people, wrong story permeating my feelings on the film, I soon tuned out &amp; waited for the theater's house lights to dim up. Look for Rudy Pankow, from Netflix's Outer Banks, playing a younger version of Holland's brother &amp; Stephen Waddington (Madeline Stowe's love interest in The Last of the Mohicans) playing Gabrielle's Scottish right hand man.

Almost drowns in mediocrity. Uncharted is a fast produced adventure movie orbiting around an average quality level. Some action sequences are okay and save the day. Characters are more or less soulless - I wait for the day when actors don't act anymore "live" but sell licences to the production companies for using their face on an digital clone made by the special effects department. The quality of acting and movie production in general is really dropping fast - but sometimes I really understand the rather lazy work of the actors, too many movie scripts are plain terrible these days, and more or less junk.

Going through a far more arduous process than many feature films would come close to experiencing when it comes to simply seeing the light of day, with news of an Uncharted movie being bandied about all the way back in 2008 with announcements following in 2010 that director David O. Russell would be the man in charge of the film as it stood those many moons ago, the first feature of the newly minted Sony Playstation Productions is thankfully more entertaining than most video game adaptations but in the harsh reality of the real world, that's not much of an achievement.Full of life, spectacle, lovable characters and more than its fair share of Indiana Jones DNA, Sony's incredibly popular Uncharted video game series is a deservedly praised property that many were excited to see be turned into a real life living and breathing entity but while director for hire Ruben Fleischer nails a few set pieces and continues on the type of form he showed with the second Zombieland and the first Venom (with his 2009 Zombieland debut feature feeling more and more like a fluke occurrence), there's a blandness too Uncharted that is unavoidable, as the low hanging fruit it clearly was attempting to reach sits firmly in its grasp.Following the treasure hunting exploits of new partners in crime, Tom Holland's daring Nathan Drake and Mark Wahlberg's long time swindler Victor Sullivan, as the two miss-matched operators attempt a globe spanning hunt of Ferdinand Magellan lost fortune that also is being hunted down by Sophia Ali's Chloe Frazer and Antonio Banderas's villain by the numbers Santiago Moncada, Uncharted is absolutely Indiana Jones lite, just without the winning jokes, the constant inventiveness and the wholly engaging characters.Getting started with a fairly eye-popping set piece that quickly gives way to an extended predominantly pedestrian formula of Drake and Sullivan getting to know each other while tracking down the next clue to their golden dreams, Uncharted struggles to do much of note for a significant amount of time with the film and us an audience awaiting something or someone to awake the films sleepwalking feeling that only really ever comes far too late in the equation when flying pirate ships and daring plane escapes take hold.Showcasing that Fleischer does know his way around an action set piece and a comedic set-up and that his tried and true performers have engaged and entertained audiences around the world countless times before, there's stages late in the piece here where Uncharted shows a little more energy and showmanship giving it more winning moments than your average video game adaptation but it's not enough to save the film entirely from its monotonous moments and uninspiring chemistry from its two main leads.Involved in the project for better part of a decade, Wahlberg was always a somewhat controversial choice as Sullivan and he does nothing to try and elevate himself from his recent funk of paycheck collecting performances and can't do enough to make us think we're watching anyone but Marky Mark while the so hot right now Holland commits himself physically as Drake, his turn also isn't worth celebrating with the two well-liked actors unable to generate much spark together let alone individually, a problem the film was never going to overcome no matter how much else it may've gotten right.Final Say -There is fun to be had from Uncharted but most of the good times start rolling in a little too late to save the day, with it's off the boil leads and by the numbers storytelling, this latest video game come to life blockbuster may not be sunken treasure but its unable to provide a reason to get excited about another hunt anytime soon.2 1/2 Naughty Dog stickers out of 5For more reviews check out Jordan and Eddie (The Movie Guys)

. . . how thoughtlessly ridiculous individuals hailing from the Iberian Peninsula actually are. A platoon of 16th Century sailors is able to devise a plethora of interlocking Rube Goldberg devices to obscure a series of incomprehensible clues to the whereabouts of five billion bucks in loot. Yet they stow their bounty is a sea cave easily accessible to anyone who happens by in a Zodiac. Is it plausible that NO ONE ventured into the yawning opening to this attractive hideout merely because it lacked a neon arrow and sign stating "Tons of gold hidden within"?

Uncharted is by no means a smart or original film but its still a really fun movie that's fast paced and consistently exciting whilst also being somewhat faithful to its source material.Tom Holland and Mark Wahlberg do not embody their video game counterparts however they still give likeable and charismatic performances with solid chemistry. Sophia Ali is great as Chloe Frazer and definitely comes closest to her character overall.Ruben Fleischer's direction is really good, action sequences are competently shot with sufficient energy and its visually slick overall. The CG is mostly impressive and the music by Ramin Djawadi is also great, fitting the film extremely well and uses the iconic theme in a satisfying way.

I've never played the games, so I don't know how accurate it is or if the characters are similar to the game counterparts. I don't know if there were references to the games!! I do think there is a cameo (on the beach), but I didn't know who he was.What I do know this movie features some of the lamest dialogue I have heard in a big screen movie in years!! And it's not even slightly believable. That said, it's action was well done and fun!!Of the cast, I liked Tom Holland, he gives a good performance and is clearly doing most of his own stunts!! He gives off Tom Cruise in Cocktail vibes during the scene in which he is working behind the bar. Mark Whalberg is Mark Whalberg, you know what you are getting. Sofia Ali was fine, but Antonio Banderas is woefully under used.I wonder how much Papa John's paid for that product placement.It features my pet hates of bloodless death's and noisy chewing, It pays tribute to/rips off Indiana Jones, but if you are going to steal, steal from the best!! But I had a good time watching itThere is a post credit scene.

Where do I start? No real drama. No character development. The most cornball dialogue. Sloppy plot. Poor use of a potentially spectacular landscape. Bland soundtrack. I think any episode of VIKINGS would surpass this film. I was blown away by how ordinary it was and almost walked out. It was cinema by numbers that added up to far less than its parts. This film should have been absolutely epic. Terribly disappointing. It was well over two hours of boredom. Anyone claiming it a masterpiece should be banned from entering Valhalla!

Well, the movie's cover/poster definitely was interesting enough to catch my attention. And I figured that with the movie's 7.8 rating on IMDb, in this writing moment, then I would be in for something grand here.And I will admit that I was excited to see what writers Sjón and Robert Eggers had in store for me here with the 2 hours and 17 minutes that the movie ran for.However, I must say that while "The Northman" was watchable, it was ultimately just another run-of-the-mill Viking-inspired movie, for better or worse. Sure, it was a watchable movie and entertaining enough for what it was. But don't get your hopes up for this one. If you've seen other Viking movies, or TV series for that matter, then you already know what you are in for here. Yeah, director Robert Eggers didn't deviate much from the how-to-make-a-Viking-saga-movie blueprint.Visually then "The Northman" was interesting, as it definitely felt like an era-appropriate movie. I did like the props, costumes, sets, scenery, etc., because it definitely looked and felt like what is usually associated with the Vikings era."The Northman" has a good cast ensemble, with the likes of Alexander Skarsgård, Nicole Kidman, Claes Bang, Ethan Hawke and even Willem Dafoe. All great talents, sure, but some of them do raise a wondering sensation as to why they were cast for a Viking movie. But on the other hand, I will say that casting Icelandic singer Björk for the movie, despite being a minor role and appearance, was just phenomenal.Something that didn't sit well with me in "The Northman", was the fact that it was English language based. Sure, I understand that from a wider appeal to the audience approach. But it just feels wrong having Vikings speak English, it just takes away from the atmosphere and the believability. And also the supernatural aspects were somewhat baffling to me. Sure, I understand that the Valkyries are a part of Norse lore, but having a pale woman with retainers on her teeth screaming and sitting on a flying horse just doesn't really work.I was expecting more than just your average generic Viking movie from director Robert Eggers, and I was somewhat disappointed when the movie just turned out to be a run-of-the-mill Viking movie. It could and should have been so much more, especially for a production of this magnitude.While "The Northman" is watchable and entertaining enough for what it turned out to be, then this is hardly a movie that I will be returning to watch a second time.My rating of "The Northman" lands on a six out of ten stars. It is the atmosphere, the brutality in the movie, and some of the performances that managed to snag the rating up from five to a six star rating for me.

This is probably the only Viking-related entertainment I have ever watched to thoroughly respect and appreciate our heritage. What a fantastic cast, cinematography and blend of realism and the supernatural. Absolutely masterfully crafted.Netflix and Marvel can try their best to ruin the image of my ancestors. All I can say is thank god for Eggers and The Northman.

I wanted to like this movie. I really did. Anything novel and not Marvel. But, unfortunately, this movie was dark, slow and not engaging. It started off with the harsh power of humanity to endure hardship and to impose it, but then went flat with the story. Nothing to learn, no one to love or hate, nothing to make you a character. Not intending the ultimate insult, but perhaps it is: you never forget you're watching a movie. You don't become one with it. However, it could win an Academy award for the production or costumes, but none of that makes up for a dark, slow and non-engaging story.

This might be an unpopular one, but I guess I have to speak the truth as I found it - which was that I was hoping "The Northman" would be a crazy, wild and brutal Viking adventure - which in some elements it is, but it's also a lyrical, arthouse-style, loose adaptation of Amleth, that perhaps caught me in the wrong mood to truly appreciate.King Aruvandil (Ethan Hawke) is a Viking King, who is murdered by his brother Fjolnir (Claes Bang) who takes his Estate and his Queen Gudrun (Nicole Kidman). Fjolnir fails to kill his son, Amleth (Oscar Novak/Alexander Skarsgard) though, who swears revenge as a child and after years killing and pillaging with an adopted clan, learns that Fjolnir has moved to Iceland. Infiltrating the household as a slave, Amelth joins forces with Olga (Anya Taylor-Joy) another slave in the house and his long-awaited vengeance begins.I can see why people liked it. It's beautiful to look at, shot in practical locations and using CGI to enhance the scenes when required, such as the epic volcano that looms over Iceland throughout the film and features in the ending. The fight scenes are generally well done, though I don't necessarily think that they were as gory as I hoped, or as others seem to have found them. Skarsgard's performance was good, though if I'm honest I'm not sure that any of the rest of the cast (perhaps with the exception of Claes Bang) really fit the roles they were playing. . . These are all actors I like in other things, but personally felt like they were miscast here.Again, I really do feel like on another day, or perhaps at home rather than at the cinema I might have enjoyed the film more, but it felt long, and I didn't care for the times when the film took its more artistic flights of fancy. The film I'd compare it too is "The Green Knight", which is similar in terms of tone and use of fantasy elements, though obviously with a different cultural mythology.It's not often that I feel like the problem with a film I haven't enjoyed might be me, rather than the film - but "The Northman" feels like a film that's going to divide it's audience and, this time, I'm not sold.

My impression of this film is that they shot a few cool viking scenes - and decided to make a story around it and just sew it together.Starts of pretty awkward then moves on to some cool raiding then it's back to awkward drama and weird scenes. Then it's a lot of fight talking then it's drama again. Then it's hallucinations and finally the movie ends.Alexander is a BEAST but the movie is so poorly edited and the story is.... Predictable.Beautiful scenery but... I nearly fell asleep.
46e57#$sw%%62$45@
The Northman's combination of a large budget and epic scale with a slow burn character drama make it an incredibly unique and rare film. A disturbingly violent yet breathtakingly beautiful exploration of the cycle of violence and it's burden on those it consumes.Alexander Skarsgård gives a phenomenal lead performance, full of a ridiculously intense physicality balanced with a visible pain and trauma. Anya Taylor-Joy is incredible with steely eyed determination and Claes Bang is terrific, bringing depth and nuance to a possibly one note character.Robert Eggers' direction is excellent, full of satisfyingly long takes, visceral action and some truly surreal imagery. The music by Sebastian Gainsborough and Robin Carolan is perfect, skillfully switching between bombastic, haunting and beautiful.

I won't waste too much time with this one. If you've had the misfortune to watch the recent movie "The Green Knight" then be prepared for more of the same pseudo art-house nonsense here.Coming from "visionary" director Robert Eggers (if you ask me, he's had one too many "visions") this is a dull, tedious slog. Now, as my title suggests, it seems inconceivable (yes I do know what that word means!) that putting vikings and a tale of vengeance together could be such a dud, but here it is.The Northman manages to take a story that should easily fit in the old 90 minute movie bracket and pad it out to nearly two and a quarter hours. The padding comes in the form of trippy daydreams/hallucinations by the main character as he suffers to satisfy his vengeance. Yeah, you'll want to skip those if you can.I've only given this as many points as I have because at least there was a small twist in the story, albeit a blindingly obvious one to do with the "hero's" mother. That, and the ending which...lets just say it isn't surprising given the story. That lack of surprise ending will still leave you with that sinking feeling. A feeling that you've just wasted two hours of your life on what amounts to an episode of Vikings that was discarded in the writer's room.SUMMARY: Going to Iceland (the store) is less tedious and frustrating than going to Iceland (the place) in this movie. Too much "visionary" and not enough "entertaining" in this one. Skip it, watch Vikings again, or Conan, or 13th Warrior or Outlander (2008). All are much, much more fun.

I had a lot of anticipation for this film since the trailer first dropped on Youtube. Many of my favorite actors are in it. The only good thing I can say about it is that it is aesthetically pretty.But visuals are only the cherry on top if a film has a solid interesting story and good actors. This film does not have a solid story. It's just a revenge flick. Holy cow is this film a snore fest. The worst part about it was the cringeworthy dialogue. This was not a script for the A-listers. I think Arnold did a better job with Conan the Barbarian. To quote a cliche, this is more image over substance. Why couldn't they just have the actors speak in ordinary English and make a solid story?Honestly, they couldn't pay me enough to rewatch this film.

The Northman (2022) is a movie my wife and I caught an advanced screening of last night. The storyline follows the son of a king whose father is murdered leading to him having to flee the kingdom leaving his mother behind. He spends his life building his strength, vision and understanding of his fate so he can obtain revenge and save his mother.This movie is directed by Robert Eggers (The Lighthouse) and stars Alexander Skarsgård (True Blood), Nicole Kidman (Eyes Wide Shut), Ethan Hawke (Training Day), Willem Dafoe (Spider-Man), Anya Taylor-Joy (The Witch) and Claes Bang (The Square).This was a very uneven movie with an incredibly predictable storyline. You literally know every single thing that is going to happen in the first 15 minutes. There's also some painfully unrealistic scenes like how the child escapes after his father is murdered. The editing could have been much better and the film definitely didn't need to be 2 hours and 15 minutes. The script also could have been better written. The cinematography was tremendous, the action scenes were fantastic, the settings and attire perfect and the cast was well selected.Overall this is a very uneven movie that required better editing, contains mediocre writing, a predictable storyline but entertaining action sequences. I would score this a 5/10 and recommend seeing it once.

Critical praise doesn't translate to the theater experience by people who actually pay. Lots of viking killing and grunting. It's almost impossible to understand what they are saying on screen. Mumbling and whispering don't help. Plus, its boring. I was thinking who in hollywood actually thought we needed this. Your move.

An epic film with a straightforward story and effective use of Norse mythology. Its intense rituals, powerful imagery, guttural and pounding music and display of culture in its authentic setting makes for an entertaining and memorable experience. Stunning scenery, brutal and bloody fight scenes and great acting performances, I thoroughly enjoyed it.

This was 50% drug trip and 50% trying to be "Conan of the Barbarians" but failing. It had good acting and the leads were believable but the frequent drug trips were offputting and it was very, very long. I went with friends and we all agreed we should have seen the new Nick Cage flick instead.

Everything about this movie screams "beastly." Literal screams along with metaphorical ones. It's a beastly movie with a beastly cast giving beastly performances behind a backdrop of beastly cinematography scored with beastly music. Beastly men in beastly fights.I had a smile on my face for most of the movie. I was fully invested in the story and characters. The directing is top-notch with a style that gives the movie a character of its own. There are so many beautiful shots. And I give it major props for going all out and holding nothing back (we need more R-rated movies!!).In my review for Dune, I mentioned that so many scenes feel so epic even without action. Regular scenes of them walking are somehow epic. It's the same way with The Northman. It's filled with epic non-action moments, which are heavily aided by the music and cinematography. When this is the case, even the slow parts feel escalated.The entire cast gives great performances, but I need to single out Anya Taylor-Joy. I want her cast in every movie. She has the acting talent as well as a screen presence and charisma that has you glued to every scene she's in. I've liked her in everything I've seen of hers, which already includes so many great movies like Split/Glass, Last Night in Soho, and Morgan. We're witnessing the birth of a star. It's possible I'm a bit biased due to her being one of the most beautiful women on the planet.I highly recommend The Northman. If any cinemas in your area are playing it on a premium screen, it's definitely worth it. Unfortunately IMAX is still showing Fantastic Beasts.

I was looking forward to "The Northman" due to a variety of different reasons.... or, if I'm being honest, just one: Anya Taylor-Joy. The talented, gorgeous seductress she is, once I learned that she would play a starring role in this film, I knew I had to see it on the largest screen possible. Unfortunately, the theatre I went to had an unfortunately small screen that certainly detracted from my viewing experience; maybe this was a strategic move, however, on the part of the studio, as now I will be going to see this movie again at a different cinema, preferably one with a bigger silver screen. And as I am so willing to go pay to see this movie again, surely I must have loved it.... right? Wrong - and don't call me Shirley."The Northman" is no doubt overhyped. Directed by Robert Eggers, who has made "The Witch" (which I adore) and "The Lighthouse" (which I haven't yet seen), "The Northman" is his third feature, one that was making a name for itself before it was even released due to how well-received his previous two movies were. In all honesty, it seems like people were ready to love this without even having seen it yet, and I believe that, because of this excitement, people (critics included) are having a difficult time looking at this movie objectively - because with all there is to appreciate, there is also an equal amount to criticize.Anya Taylor-Joy is perfection, as always - she's not just beautiful, but she is proving her range as an actress in each and every role she chooses. Yes, she may have been my reason for buying a ticket to this, but I was equally as impressed with virtually everyone in here. Alexander Skarsgård is one of my favorite actors, and he was very effective as a monstrous brooding brute. Ethan Hawke and Nicole Kidman also do well with what they have; in short, the acting is good - that is, when the script allows it to be. Because, even though the actors and actresses are clearly committed to their parts, the script is full of borderline embarrassing dialogue. Conversations have no substance to them, with people speaking as if they've never spoken before. Many lines are simplistic to the extreme, almost as if they were written by a mediocre fan fiction writer. You can almost look past it due to the clear competence of the performers, but my near constant eye rolls had me wishing for a better screenplay.If you've seen the trailer for this, you already know the movie looks incredible - and it does. My eyes were constantly glued to the screen, soaking up the scenery. Similarly, my ears found themselves honed in on the soundtrack; basically a star in and of itself, the score here booms through the theatre sound systems. Ominous and engrossing, the soundtrack is nearly constant, seeping everything in a sense of horror and unease - and it's effective (and so loud that, even if you find yourself bored, you won't be able to fall asleep). Visually and audibly, "The Northman" is 100% worth the price of admission. From a plot and story perspective, however, you'll find it lacking."The Northman" has a simplistic story - perhaps too simplistic for its own good. Following a young Viking prince on his quest to avenge his father's murder, you'd think that Eggers would have something unique up his sleeve. I assumed that he'd either fill this movie with great action and have this be his entry into blockbuster filmmaking, or if not that, at the least attempt to throw a wrench in what is otherwise a traditional revenge movie. Alas, he does neither! "The Northman" does not have enough action to qualify as a satisfying action movie (granted, the action is filmed well, but is surprisingly tame and not as bloody as I expected or wanted) nor does it have enough plot twists to switch things up from average revenge fare. The movie meanders, barely picking up any steam except for the occasional burst of violence. You'll spend a lot of time watching characters engage in uninteresting conversations that could've been interesting with better dialogue. You'll see psychedelic dream sequences that are unique the first time, and then quickly overplayed by the second, third, fourth, and fifth time. The story lacks focus; so sure, while you'll see a visual feast of Norse culture that never really leads anywhere, you'll also find yourself asking whether you're watching a revenge movie or a historically accurate portrayal of 900 A. D. life.In many ways "The Northman" delivers. It's great to look at (and not just because of Anya Taylor-Joy), with truly immersive world building that draws viewers in with overwhelming sights and sounds. This is a brutal film, one that's not afraid to show Norse culture as it was. This is also a film that has a shocking lack of direction. While I would never say I was bored or disengaged, I can say I found myself slightly confused at the way the movie plodded along; for a movie that's over two hours, not much happens, and when things do happen, it isn't very interesting. I was disappointed in "The Northman," but even so, cannot deny the quality of its technical aspects - I only wish that quality carried over in the storytelling.

Great sets, check. Scenic locations, check. Blood, murder, and vengeance, check. Meandering script made this seem like it was over 3 hours long. Not impressed at all and was expecting much more.

While they definitely aren't for all tastes, I was blown away by the originality and singular visions of "The Witch" and "The Lighthouse," even if they still are so specific that I still had my criticisms of them. As a result, I was hoping for this to be a truly unique and memorable cinematic experience. Unfortunately, it looks and sounds incredible but otherwise ended up being a letdown in my book. It's certainly Eggers' weakest film yet, which is disappointing.The film centers on a Viking whose father is killed by his uncle when he is very young. Decades later, he is a berserker raiding villages who ends up plotting a bloody plot for vengeance. Shot on location in Iceland, the film's cinematography is often beautiful, with expansive and wide shots. The film's score is also stirring and authentic. Everything looks and sounds incredible in a Dolby Cinema screen, accentuated by Eggers' precise attention to historical accuracy that we see throughout his films. Tragically, though, these technical qualities are about where the strengths of the film end. Unlike "The Witch" and "The Lighthouse," this film feels oddly derivative. The story feels like a recycled revenge plot, and the brutal Viking action doesn't feel like something we haven't seen before. While those two other films generally lacked plots in a conventional sense, people who enjoyed them could successfully argue that they made up for such a lack of plot in clear vision. They were uniquely atmospheric and created pitch-perfect senses of suspense and dread, accentuated by the period detail and aesthetics. Unfortunately, "The Northman" just doesn't feel as atmospheric or tonally unique. This might in part be caused by the fact that it has a much bigger budget than those other two films, but it also means that I feel the film dragged on a bit longer than it should have. You can have a unique plot and/or an engaging atmosphere. Some films have one of these elements, and some have both. But unfortunately, I feel like the derivativeness of the plot and the sometimes-choppy editing and pacing ended up getting the better of it. In "The Lighthouse" and "The Witch," you felt genuine psychological peril that could make you appreciate the comparatively low-but-serious stakes of the characters. The same cannot be said here. All of the violent Viking action is plentiful, but it gets very predictable and repetitive, and simply just doesn't feel as impactful or soulful as genuine psychological suspense and taut narrative creativity. Sadly, I don't recommend this one. 5/10Note: I saw the film in Dolby Cinema. The picture and sound quality were excellent.

My first impression is that this is a contender for the Most Metal Movid. It's like when you first see The Wild Bunch with a good screen and sound, you leave with more chest hair than when you came into it (whether you're a man or a woman). It's brawny, bloody, brutal, graphic revenge fiction made by a filmmaker who is so sincere that any further to the right or left and it could could self parody. It never is and if I found myself chuckling over how unique a giant vision of how violence dooms.... everything and everyone.Eggers and his absolute Top of the Heap artisans and designers, from the designers of those trippy sequences to whichever team made *that* severed head to the volcano set piece and location scouts etc etc, manage to transport you to a time and place that is not familiar to I'd suspect 90% of us, and even for like a Game of Thrones comparison that has more of a modern sensibility and humor than this. Eggers and Sion manages to pack two semesters worth of study on Mythology into a little over two hours in a completely organic sensibility.But there's a mystery to parts of the symbolism here that I'm sure will keep me coming back to analyze things like the Supernatural and otherworldly (are they totems to the afterlife? What about the Valhalla woman on the horse riding into the sky? Well... all of a piece, right). Amid the transporting into this other realm is this sense that violence is so overencompansing it can swallow you whole.And the performances add to this feeling of fervor and intensity and with 11000% pathos going on in that similar sincerity with the design elements. And occasionally much needingly with Anya Taylor Joy, who is so strong as the pulsating beating heart beneath this thing. Someone like her character helps to not so much soften but balance out how almost everyone else here, certainly Skarsgard in a towering and angry but vulnerable turn but also Hawke in his time and Kidman when she gets her moments (next Oscar already throw her one she is staggeringly good), is firing on these cylinders of seriousness and primal rage and sadness and just.... fire is the word for it. If you've ever seen a Heavy Metal album cover the actors are channeling *every one that has ever existed* into this one film (Bjork being like the weirdo Norway metal for her minute or two).Robert Eggers has been a filmmaker to watch for a while now. With this, he joins the all timers. What a master. What a giant hunk of 20 pound steak of a movie with grizzled onions and hot pepper. Sorry guess it made me hungry for meat.

Like his memorable period piece freak-outs "The Witch" and "The Lighthouse," though on a vastly more ambitious scale, bloody and deliciously violent. The Northman is a big-budget epic, but it retains those indie roots, and in " Robert Eggers " fashion , very aesthetically pleasing. This film delivers ! Powerhouse performances and otherworldly imagery . I highly recommend at some point to see this blood-soaked odyssey !! Sooner rather than later. A cinematic saga. The cast in this one is absolutely incredible. Check out the cast ....
The Northman starring Alexander Skarsgard, Anya Taylor-Joy, Nicole Kidman, Ethan Hawke, Willem Dafoe, and Björk.

My Review - The Northman
My Rating 1/10Possibly the worst film I've ever seen ?Robert Eggers labelled as a visionary Director also co wrote this trash with someone called Sjón.I'm not saying Robert Eggers isn't talented I gave his 2009 film "The Lighthouse " a 9/10 and enjoyed it immensely . It was also dark and depressing but superbly written and acted.I'm also certainly not saying the rest of the cast in this salute to sadomasochism bad taste and male grunting and bonding are untalented either .Why or how talented actors like Nicole Kidman , Willem Dafoe, Ethan Hawk, Alexander Skarsgård and Anya Taylor-Joy would tarnish their reputations to appear in a 136 minute depressing violent and naive movie that in my view is an insult to the heritage of the proud Viking race I can't answer probably because their million dollar salaries could have purchased some of the delightful Celtic jewellery in this bleak epic movie.We've visited Viking museums in Norway and Denmark and seen the treasures and ships of these proud people who were of course violent and warlike but really no more than certain races are in our modern world I think it's insulting to parody a race or culture in such a depressing and frankly demeaning manner.I generously give a 1/10 rating purely for the 2 laughs that I got out of it.When Queen Gudrun's time to leave this mortal coil finally came and she simply says "thank you." so did I but I had to wait till the end titles of The Northman finally appeared on screen.I turned to my favourite movie partner and just said " Do you realise that this film probably will make more than Stephen Spielberg's West Side Story at the box office .We saw it on the Cinema screen and the sets special affects and monochrome depressing dark colour palette seemed as fake as the banal script .It will be streaming eventually so my advice is wait till then when you can switch it off or grab a Valium to ease the depression. I nearly walked out but it was dark and I couldn't risk falling over.

Amleth (Alexander Skarsgård) wants to avenge his father King Aurvandil War-Raven (Ethan Hawke) who was killed by his uncle Fjölnir The Brotherless (Claes Bang). Fjölnir stole his father's kingdom and his mother Queen Gudrún (Nicole Kidman). It's early tenth century. He has been raised as a berserker pillaging for a slaving warlord. A defeated witch proclaim his prophesized vengeance. He pretends to be a slave to be sold to Fjölnir. Olga of the Birch Forest (Anya Taylor-Joy) is a fellow slave who sees through his ruse.This is a stylish brutal tale of violence and revenge worthy of the Vikings. This is a Scandinavian legend which supposedly inspired Hamlet. It's Game of Thrones and Conan the Barbarian except more brutal. The acting is great with a shocking turn from Nicole Kidman. She's always great but in this one, she accesses something manically dark. I would make a small addition. An exterior Christian threat needs to be stated more prominently so that they're automatically assumed to be the killers. The naked bodies should be positioned into a cross or maybe they could be crucified. That would be enough of a misdirection. Otherwise, Amleth would be a good suspect. The family should not be that clueless. Overall, this is a brutal and stylish revenge tale worthy of Shakespeare although Amleth is no Hamlet.

Considering the trailer had the quote being said over and over again ("I will avenge you ... I will save you .. I will kill you ..." leaving the spaces on purpose in case someone has not seen the trailer, you can find out about that in the movie then), it is a bit surprising that the grown man we see seems to have forgotten about the words he uttered over and over again as a kid.That being said, it does give another nice turning point and introduces us to an interesting and intriguing character. I am not too familiar with Vikings folklore and saga (I didn't even know much about the History behind the very good tv show Vikings), but I imagine Eggers did quite a bit of research. And I think you can tell by watching it. Even if I hadn't seen a video of him explaining one scene (the first time we see the adult version of out main character that is, on a boat), I could feel that there is a lot of authenticity in the movie.That begins with the set and production design and goes beyond that to the lighting and costumes. The movie is quite dark and while they surely must have used artificial lighting (or at least some digital enhancement), it does feel like you only get the natural lighting that the scene provides. That is quite astounding, all things considered. Especially how producers and audiences want or are used their movies to look like.Talking about looking like: if you are into handsome and well trained bodies, the movie will please with Skarsgard and his transformation - his physical appearance that is. But the movie does not only look good, it also sounds good. While the Green Knight still is something I will remember fondly when it comes to its sound design, this also makes the best use of music and general sounds to create an atmosphere that is truly amazing.There is so much one can write about this and you do not even have to go into the revenge theme of the movie. Or the Valhalla saga - or anything related to the story. Or any of the specific characters - because while the movie seems straightforward, there are a couple of twists along the way. Although I kind of felt one of them more or less coming. Not all of the twist and I did not suspect the reasons behind it, but it did make sense the way it was presented.If you have seen an Eggers movie (The Witch and The Lighthouse come to mind right now), you will be familiar that his movies are not easy. They are also not exactly something that anyone would call blockbuster material ... but they are very well done. And while this takes its time too, to get us to the good parts, there quite a few we will encounter. You can not be faint hearted or easily offended though. I suspect that what I read about producers interfering might have had some impact towards the end. Especially with one scene where the death of a character is not as graphic as it could be, because ... well political correctness and all that. But you'll understand once you see it.Certain things seem inevitable ... and the movies end is one of them. Greatly achieved though - and so well shot. There could have been even more blood, but that doesn't mean that the movie holds back. Also the long tracking shots combined with the action they portray surely where quite hard to achieve anyway or as it is. I can highly recommend this - and I am happy I watched it in cinemas too.

The director/writer of this movie must be an imbecile. I think a 13 YR old could write better. What the heck was this movie?A copycat of Hamlet and Conan and probably something else, except it's 100% worst than all of them.This movie is THAT pathetic. Heck, this movie makes Michael Bay look like an academy award best-Director.I am still so speechless and shocked at how dumb this movie is. I went from watching other Norse mythologies like Vikings, Vikings Valhalla, The Last Kingdom, Beowulf, The 13th Warrior, Ragnarok, Thor and Loki, to watching this pile of crap that I don't even know what to call.
46e57#$sw%%62$45@
I'll start with the good. The Icelandic scenery is strikingly beautiful, ... um, I guess that's it.The rest is an utter disaster. The screenplay is perhaps the worst of all, being completely derivative. The story is mainly that of Hamlet (and in case we don't get it, the main character is even named Hamlet). Some elements of the plot have been borrowed from The Last Kingdom. Much of the imagery comes from Lord of the Rings. The dialogue is stilted, phony, dull and predictable. The entire movie comes across as a series of cliches, pretty much every Viking stock scene is played for us in succession but with no point or purpose. You're never quite sure if this is meant to be a fantasy story or a realistic one, and while it's never convincing enough for realism, it's not mythical enough to be a saga. And the carnage... two-plus hours of unabated slaughter.Spare yourself the agony, and don't waste your money. If it's Vikings your after, check out The Last Kingdom instead.

"Be kind, especially when you don't know what's going on."If only we could recognize that those who combat us in life do so out of hidden pain, and fight them with kindness. If only we could accept our kids for who they are, and say supportive things from the heart instead of trying to mold them. If only we could be content with the life we have, and set aside the idea of the countless other lives we might have led, had we made different decisions along the way. If only we could see that the flipside to life being meaningless and everything ultimately being sucked into the abyss is the freedom that comes from that, that we can do anything with the time we've got.Like the first word in its title, this film feels like everything. While watching it I thought Stephanie Hsu was everything too, but then again, so was Michelle Yeoh and Jamie Lee Curtis. The homage to Wong Kar-Wai with Ke Huy Quan making his enlightened speech is extraordinary, and the fact that James Hong was still getting it done at age 93 was wonderful. I also loved how both mother and daughter, troubled as they were with their upbringing, each found comfort in a kind and patient partner, and Tallie Medel's character was a nice touch.The film threatens to go off the rails with its madcap multiverse hopping in the first part, but it's all a setup for the second part, which is incredibly powerful. It was impressive that it managed to be so entertaining along the way, with its fast-paced action and the wild ride it takes us on. It's one that rewards a rewatch to, as its full of little details and references. Just a great film, lots of fun, and from the heart.

Profoundly deep, genuinely moving, utterly hilarious, highly imaginative and a visual feast. Haven't laughed this hard, cried this much or thought so deeply about any film in 2022 Much less all in the same viewing. This was indeed everything, everywhere all at once.

I have trouble turning off my brain. Anxieties, worries, mundane to-dos, even positive things, sometimes feel like they're swirling around in a chaotic funnel cloud and I would like nothing more than to sit in physical and mental silence."Everything Everywhere All At Once" felt like the inside of my head. In a world of non-stop, 24/7 news, most of it bad, how is a person like me, who has trouble filtering out things that affect me directly from all of the other things that are just out there happening in general and over which I have no control, supposed to cope?One answer is to decide that nothing matters anyway and give up caring. But that means deciding that my wife doesn't matter. And that my kids don't matter. And that art, and nature, and things that bring joy to my life, don't matter.Another way is to decide that some things, ok maybe most things, don't matter, but that there are things that do, and those are the things that make it all worth it. I get to decide what those things are.The first approach is nihilistic. The second approach is empowering. This film explores both approaches, and I was a sobbing mess at the end.I will say there were times that I was a bit exhausted by this movie. It throws a lot on the screen and at the viewer, and occasionally it can't keep up with its ambitions. But this was mostly a home run.Michell Yeoh does terrific work in this, but the MVP is Ke Huy Quan (Short Round from the "Indiana Jones" movies).Grade: A.

Everything Everywhere All At Once is even crazier than the trailer would lead one to believe. It's bursting with so many original, weird concepts and ideas that no serious storyteller in their right mind would ever dare to put in their movie. But Daniels did. And it works with spectacularly effective results.These filmmakers choose not only to put every bizarre idea they could think of into their movie, but they ensure that every oddity adds something to the thought-provoking, emotionally resonant themes that pervade the story. So many angles can be explored surrounding this story of emotional connection and the things that distract from it.As Evelyn connects with her alternate selves and alternate relatives, there is both envy of and pity toward them that is explored. It's such a cathartic experience to watch this woman discover what she truly wants from life and loves about her life.All of the beautiful themes and heartwarming character moments are just the tip of the iceberg here, though. This is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen.The Daniels lean into the absurdity of the world that they have created, always reaching for the most outlandish possibilities and never playing it safe. It makes for some truly outstanding visual gags that will never leave my mind., and it makes for the most unique viewing experience I have ever had in my life.This is a masterpiece of originality. There is not, nor will there ever be, a film quite like this one. And I cannot wait to watch it again and again and again.

Most of us who are mindful of the film can agree on one thing, Everything Everywhere All at Once feels like you're walking on an acid trip experience. It's an imaginary film that makes you feel like you had just swallowed a bottle of limitless pills, dopes, drugs or other substances that may similarly affect your consciousness and memories.And this movie deliversssssssssss that! Wow wow wow! Imagine if Dr Strange, Limitless, The Matrix, Click, Rick &amp; Morty, Star Wars, Ratatouille and Manchester By the Sea combined to become a film, Everything Everywhere All at Once is the one! Now you must be wondering, how could Ratatouille and The Matrix complement each other to be in the same movie? 🤣🤣🤣 This question should be THE reason you should go support this film now in cinemas!Produced by A24, an independent film company, I was surprised at how they have pulled this off. Half of the film is located at an office, which is understandable considering A24 produces low or semi-budget films. But it's such a wonder how this movie could be so good with only so few places the movie took place for the first hour. What's even better is EEAAO occurred within closed and overcrowded spaces that may slightly trigger people experiencing ADHD, hypersensitivity and claustrophobia, pushing the film into maximum impact.This film is filled with action-packed sequences that will blow you brains out! It's fun, exhilarating, creative, hilarious and never-been-done-before! Adding up with the out-of-the-world concept and unique storyline, every fighting scene seems appropriately done and even if there's just so many styles and tones of scenes coming out from the screen, fitting is the right word to describe them.EEAAO seems like any other movie at the beginning but when all hell breaks loose, the story becomes increasingly complex as it explains the world revolving around the central character, propelling the plot into motion. Meticulously explained, the narrative manages to be exciting and outrageously wild but reasonable within its own multiverse contexts.Michelle Yeoh, our Malaysian actress 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻, is excellent in this, proving that she's fluid in bringing out the best of her multiple character(s). Complicated as it is, she knew what kind of project she's doing and it just shows how dedicated she is at acting. It's not easy to play her role and it's definitely not easy to create multiple personas interconnected by different universes and dimensions, with separate storylines, all destined to have the same fate. This is an Oscar-worthy performance, and whether or not if Yeoh got nominated lies on the decision if the Oscar recognizes speculative fiction as a genre acceptable to compete with other highly-appraisal films.There were many genuinely laugh-out-loud moments throughout, NOT the one where you're forced to laugh just because everyone is laughing to avoid the awkwardness surrounding the audience in the hall, but the one that it's just funny you're having a truly good time. The script and performance help to amplify the comedic moment but the most special thing is that it's aware of its VFX effects and the team knows how to level up/down the intensity and realness of the CGI. How so? The CGI is very good, but there are times that the CGI is made to be purposely bad, like you're watching a short film by a bunch of ambitious varsity students, and it works! It works because everyone in the theater was laughing, it clicks just right with the moments and scenes you're watching. You'll laugh at how bad it is in a good way!If there's one dislike from this film is that it's gonna be a tough watch for some people. Like mentioned earlier, those with ADHD and hypersensitivity may be triggered with the intensity of this film. Also, the storyline is difficult for some to digest due to its complexity of its universe-building. The film is promoted as being light and fun but...EEAAO is weighty, dark, bizarre and surreal, only those who have what it takes can appropriately understand the building block storytelling.Verdict: Mind-bending and mind-blowing, Everything Everywhere All at Once masters its building block storytelling that feels like an acid trip worth experiencing and that experience... can only be felt once in a lifetime. We're only in March but without a doubt, this is already the best film of the year! Sorry, summer blockbuster movies!

It was everything everywhere all at once. Sometimes too many things, too many places at once and you can get lost, but it helps to focus on things.Obviously, the amazing Michelle Yeoh is one thing to focus on. The whole reason I myself came to see this flick in the first place. Much as this movie gives you to absorb it was easy to keep my eyes on the beautiful Yeoh.Oh, and the kid from Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom is in this flick. He's older odiously but he still sounds like the kid form The Goonies. How lucky he was he got to play Yeoh's baby daddy in this joint.Last and definitely not least it was good to see James Wong in this film. You could tell they most likely made some filming adjustments to assure the 90 something year old actor can do the role but that's what you do when you have legends do your flick.Speaking of legends, almost forgot about Jamie lee Curtis who seem like she was having fun in her role.The fact that this movie is about a multiverse I low key was expecting a multiverse connection between who Yeoh plays in this movie, and her character in Shang shi. That would have been cool.It's interesting that this like the third movie that came out in March that's about the mommy daughter relationship between Asian women. What's even more interesting is how they go in order. Turning Red is about a 13-year-old and Her mom, Umma is about an 18-year-old and her mom and the girl playing Yeoh's daughter looks like she's possibly in her early 20s. Don't know when this became a hot plot in movies, but I will admit I prefer how the story lays out here (but only because I relate more to an Asian woman in her 20s over a middle schooler)The music in this film is great. The movie was filmed in the context that the story is about a laundromat owner in her mid-life dealing with where she came from and where she's going, but the music actually fits perfectly into the ideal of this woman being the key to saving the multiverse and it made for a lot of the entertainment. Just these big orchestra cues that make it sound like I'm watching Dune contradicting, the image of Yeoh being a worn-out blue-collar mom. Spectacular!I say it's good. It's all over the place and it can be a handle to process, but it has a good cast to concentrate on.

If you take drugs for the first time and imagined Jackie Chan was a female Dr. Strange in another universe this would be it. And the synopsis is basically an Asian woman trying to do her taxes. I thought the third act of the movie felt a little stretched out but otherwise I think it's the best movie I've seen all year because I haven't laughed this much in any recent one. From the short time I spent in China, it's also an accurate and hilarious view of Chinese parents 'cause they really do be like that. I can't recommend it enough, it's so chaotic and in the middle of all that managed to be heartfelt too. I thought it was gonna be a Dr Strange wannabe but it's unique on it's own and I'm glad it was released earlier so that people don't compare them. It was just four people (strangers) in the cinema, we were laughing our asses off and it made me sad because everyone deserves to see this. At a time when remakes and reboots are common place it's nice to have something like this, a breath of fresh air.

Rarely does a movie hit me hard and I go along for the ride. Every moment has a spectacle to it. Even the simplicity of having your taxes done. Often silly, mostly confusing but entirely entertaining. It was great to see Short Round back on the big screen with a very glamoured down Michelle Yeoh as a married couple on the brink of fracturing a family unit.The story is of, Evelyn, a woman who has never really committed to much in life. She has many interest but many where she isn't fully invested in. In this case, her family lives above the laundromat that is failing. They are being audited, but yet she has big dreams to expand her enterprise. Her husband (the fore mentioned Ke Huy Quan) Waymond, is a kindly follower and believer of his wife who seems to focus more on the bad than the good. Pessimist, if we are to be formal. It is the Chinese New Year, and many people are invited to celebrate with this family, including a Grand-Father who is labeled as a man set in his ways and wouldn't understand the same-sex relationship of his grandaughter Joy (Stephanie Hsu). What follows is a grand adventure, first at the IRS building (of all places) and eventually to distant alternate universes to which shows her the way her life may have gone had certain things didn't take place. I absolutely loved the fact that Jamie Lee Curtis plays the uptight auditor, who seems perfectly fine in the core universe to which all revolve around. Evelyn, on the other hand, taps into her other universes to gather the skills needed to fight a fracture in the timelines that sneak into her mundane life.Yes, there is a message here. And...to be honest, it nearly derails the film itself. But it was required to tie in the meaning of everything that is going on. That we are made of experiences of every universe that exists out there (if you believe in metaphysics) and that they road you didn't take, through gained experiences, with some that even was more enticing then the present one, means we would never have known our other lives. Children wouldn't be born, love would be lost, relationships move on. It is the grand question of whether or not if we got a glimpse of that road we didn't take, would it all mean anything. In this case, I say it almost derails because the universes effect one another. And in this story, it even bridges them. Which to some, may feel like a cheat. However, the fact that I even ask this question makes it a vastly interesting story. That is for you to decide.The movie is exciting, vibrant, energetic and feels absolutely unique. It allows the viewer to slowly tie the ends together, and perhaps sometimes gets too far ahead. But doesn't let you lose yourself too much. What it isn't is boring. It is captivating and fresh. And, look, who can hate a scene of people being beaten with rubber phalluses?That said, it is one of the most interesting movies of 2022 and hopefully stays in the minds of awards in the future. Because it deserves a bigger audience. These are the types of fun, philosophical questions buoyed by comedy that we need.I go back to Ke Huy Quan. This guy can do funny and also bring a tug to your heart so easily. It's so hard to imagine him as the little boy from "Indiana Jones And The Temple Of Doom" because, here he shows so much range. His natural charm is shown through his love for Evelyn. He seems to be suffering through a fracture himself. He plays many roles here as well. Because, in many universes in life, the theory here may be that we will run into people we are meant to run into regardless of choices. That's a very romanticized view on the universe.Kudos to The Daniels for their talent and joy of cinema. It would not surprise me if they helm a larger film in the future. Perhaps they can re-vamp a comic book franchise into something much more unique.Thank you for this movie.

Michelle Yeoh headlines this head trip into the multi-verse. The first part is slow going as this reality is not suggested in the previews and thus somewhat lulls the audience into expecting something different. But what makes this movie really work is its underlying storyline even as reading subtitles and trying to understand what is going on during the first half of the movie takes a bit of mental endurance. Allowing for that though, this movie bursts at the seams in being everything all at once, sequentially that is, in two-dimensions trying to project a four-dimensional reality and a multitude of parallel universes that all include Michelle Yeoh in some form or fashion. This movie definitely breaks through to a new level of sci fi visual delight and sophistication along with a strong storyline. Like Inception (2010), this is a breakthrough movie setting a higher bar of sci fi movies in the future.

This film almost unanimously received praise from both critics and audience alike. People even exaggeratedly rank it as one of the greatest films ever or the best they've ever seen. Going into this movie, my expectations were really high And I really wanted to be part of the majority who loves this movie. But unfortunately the opposite happened and I didnt like it. While I appreciate that this movie was made on a relatively small budget and managed to get some things right as it had so much potential with its strong female lead, philosophical component and some good action to move it along. But it fell really short. It is long and meandering. Visually confusing, thematically unoriginal. The first half was repetitive, boring and also quite silly. Half of the time I don't know what are they fighting for or what the heck is going on. And what was supposed to be the multiverse just felt like the characters were wearing silly different costumes. It is not until the last act that things of relevance happened. The performance from the cast was great though.

It's very rare that I give a movie a full score. This is because when I look at my list later, I want full score movies to really mean something. "Everything Everywhere All at Once" was such a masterpiece, being both experimental yet grounded, absurdist yet profound. Everything about this film was amazing. The story. The performances. Even the metatextual casting of Michelle Yeoh is fascinating, since Michelle Yeoh is an actress that really has lived a million lives in her own multiverse. This film absolutely floored me.

Apparently the IMDb plot synopsis before this movie's trailer came out was "a woman tries to do her taxes," and really, the plot's so creative and goes to so many unpredictable places that I don't think you should know much more than that going in. It is about a woman doing her taxes, technically, but branches off in a variety of ways that make this an action/adventure/absurdist comedy/fantasy/science-fiction/family drama all in one.All the tones and all the genres are balanced perfectly. It's masterfully written and overflowing with creativity. The editing is unbelievable and all the elements work together so well. It has some of the funniest and silliest scenes I've seen in ages that mesh perfectly well with some genuinely touching dramatic moments, and it has characters you really come to care for.The action delivers, too, and there's just the right amount of it. I love how thrillingly strange the film is for a while, then you begin to make sense of it, and then it just keeps expertly piling more and more layers on, and does so over a fast-paced 139 minutes in a way where it never actually falls apart. Also: it has some of the best film references/parodies I've ever seen, for sure.All the acting is fantastic, too, and everyone understood the insane vision the directors were trying to achieve, and played their parts perfectly. Michelle Yeoh is maybe the best she's ever been here, and Stephanie Hsu, Ke Huy Quan, and Jamie Lee Curtis are all great too.Maybe original ideas are becoming harder and harder to come by, but for as long as movies like Everything Everywhere All At Once are coming out, the medium of film will never be truly artistically bankrupt. There have been movies that have tackled some of the ideas here before, but never in a way that's this creative, this funny, and this exciting, and the way it takes its outlandish premise and ties it to real life + real world + relatable emotions is so incredibly clever.I haven't seen every movie of the 2020s of course, but as of writing this, this is my favourite movie of the 2020s so far. I hope it performs extremely well at the box office and gets awards recognition, because it deserves it.Believe the hype.Go in knowing as little as possible.See this movie.
46e57#$sw%%62$45@
This might be the most accurately titled film I have ever seen. Afterwards, my wife asked me what it reminded me of. I was stumped. What genre was it? Hard to say. This is a movie that morphs from immigrant drama to sci fi to Kung Fu to comedy to existential art flick and back again. Then it does that loop again, faster and faster and faster, without ever losing the audience. I saw it in a packed theater, everyone laughing and crying and caring. Perhaps most amazingly, this was a pretty simple and effective relationship story through it all. I don't know if I would rather watch it again right now or watch a documentary about how the film took shape. Either way, I'm glad it exists. I lamented multiverse stories after the last MCU film, and I guess I have to take that back now. It is possible to tell wildly imaginative genre bending multiverse stories. You just don't need superheroes to do it (unless you count the Daniels).
46e57#$sw%%62$45@
It's been a long time since i felt this way watching a film and wanting it just to end, This is a perfect example of how a good idea can turn into a waste. I really wanted to like this film but unfortunately i felt frustrated, irritated, disgusted and bored all at once.
46e57#$sw%%62$45@
I think they were trying to be deep and profound, but what resulted was two hours of head-splitting chaos and confusion. It is a shame, because I had high hopes for this movie. I just don't understand the hype. They tried too hard to be weird. I think at the end they were trying to pull the heartstrings, but I was too confused to know for sure. I'm not even sure what the movie was about. I think it had something to do with familial relations, or perhaps current tax laws? Whatever it was, they should have had an epileptic seizure warning.
46e57#$sw%%62$45@
At the risk of angering what seems to be the entire movie going populous, I'm just gonna say it - this movie is fine.Funny in places, exciting in places, pretty emotional in places. But can someone please explain why movies these days feel like they need to be so damn long? Seriously, this could have been 100 minutes, easily. It's way too indulgent. Scenes drag on and on and when they're over you're still no further to any semblance of plot clarity than you were 10 minutes earlier. It seems like they shot tonnes of footage and just wanted to include it all, without really embellishing the actual story. If the movie was more succinct and arrived more quickly at the overall point of the narrative, that being her connection with her daughter, I would have liked it a lot more.I just really don't understand why producers and writers are electing their films to be these immense lengths these days when they really don't need to be. No Way Home, Don't Look Up, Licorice Pizza, Drive My Car, all over 2 hours for no good reason.I really felt the length of this movie was to the detriment of the overall narrative and it disallowed me appreciating what the message was meant to be.That being said, the direction and editing was cool, acting was strong and the scene at the end with the daughter really did hit all the right notes. You could have trimmed a lot of fat off of this though and made it far stronger in my opinion.

Greetings again from the darkness. It's bonkers, I tell ya'! Co-writers and co-directors Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert, known collectively (by their choice) as "Daniels", follow up their 'farting corpse movie' SWISS ARMY MAN (2016) with one that is somehow more bizarre, more audacious, and more fun. It's one of the most innovative films I've seen in a while, and although I can point out influences, I've yet to come up with a movie comparison that seems just or fair.Every small business owner can relate to the stress Evelyn Wang (Michelle Yeoh) is under as she attempts to organize her documents in preparation for an IRS audit of the laundromat she owns with her husband Waymond Wang (Ke Huy Quan). As if that's not enough, her father is scheduled to arrive the same day. She knows Gong Gong (James Hong) is disappointed in his daughter for the husband and life she chose. And while being crushed with those two events, Evelyn's strained relationship with her daughter Joy (Stephanie Hsu) continues to fracture as Evelyn wants to keep Joy's girlfriend status with Becky (Tallie Medel) a secret from dear old conservative dad/grandfather.That's just about the end of the "normal" part of the story, other than Waymond has had divorce papers prepared, not for the purpose of ending the marriage, but with the hope that the threat might force Evelyn to have a real conversation with him about their relationship. Things start to get weird even before they head to the IRS meeting with an agent played with gusto by Jamie Lee Curtis, but while there, we get our first real taste of the fantastical trip we (and Evelyn) are about to take. Of course, I can't really offer any description of the action that occurs, but nothing is spoiled if I tell you that some characters cross multiple dimensions and universes in an attempt to 'save the world'. While doing this, they mix in some acrobatic martial arts that would make Jackie Chan envious.It's the rare film where the frenetic pace of dialogue keeps pace with breakneck action sequences. A fanny pack, trophies with an unfortunate shape, and blue-tooth type devices all play unusual roles here, and this film challenges everyone from the actors to the directors to the editors to the fight coordinators. You'll likely recognize Evelyn's husband as the grown-up version of the child actor who played Short Round in INDIANA JONES AND THE TEMPLE OF DOOM (1984), and daughter Joy is portrayed by Stephanie Hsu (a contributor to "The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel"), who gets to cover just about the widest range of character we've likely ever seen on screen. The estimable James Hong is a riot as Gong Gong. Mr. Hong is now 93 years old with an incredible canon of 450 credits in his 8 decades of work. His presence is quite crucial to the film. It should also be noted that, as we would expect, Jenny Slate shines in her brief role as "Big Nose", a regular customer at the laundromat.As terrific as the cast is, this is really a chance for Michelle Yeoh to bring her full arsenal to the role of Evelyn. She's angry, frustrated, scared, courageous, and even adds her comic timing. Ms. Yeoh flashes her CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON fighting skills, while also brining a regal presence to a film that requires a strong core. It's no mystery that family and love can solve many of the world's issues, and Daniels have delivered a wild ride that defies simple description. It's a long one at 139 minutes, but you'll thank me later for not saying much more than ... it's bonkers!Opens in select markets on March 25 and April 1, 2022 and nationwide on April 8, 2022.

Now I'm clearly a minority based on the reviewers but that's ok, how is this an 8.9 on IMDB? It was confusing, overly long and repetitive. I'm giving up on these films, same as French Dispatch, rubbish. I cannot work out what it was about and why I paid $20 to watch it.
46e57#$sw%%62$45@
I honestly didn't get it. It felt like an Asian acid trip. I had trouble following the plot and found most of the skits not adult funny, so I gave up halfway through the film. I did feel bad for the actor that played an IRS security agent that got beaten up by a girl swinging two giant anatomically correct white dildos. His off-set friends at his local pub are not going to let him live that scene down. You got beaten down to the floor with what?
46e57#$sw%%62$45@
I'd heard good things about this, but the fact of the matter is it's basically just any of the Matrix films jumbled up with some overused Spider-verse/ Dr Strange / Rick &amp; Morty, etc. "multiverse" plot ideas that I've seen far too many times now to find innovative or get excited over.I admire the filmmakers attempting something technically more challenging than the average flick but the end result is just a very shallow and boring film with no interesting characters to connect with or care about, and it felt to me just another one of those recent things made by people who've grown up almost exclusively on video games and so confuse unlocking game levels with storytelling. Because of this, no characters feel real or believable: everyone in it's just an NPC, and so their lives and life events have no weight or depth.It's all sound and fury, signifying nothing, and I'm sorry to have to say I couldn't get all the way through it. But my own life's better for that.

On the positive side you have Michelle Yeoh who is a great actress and the two directors have some funny and original ideas. But it becomes pretty unbearable to watch as they keep on repeating the same ideas and visuals again and again. A bit surprised by the overwhelming positive reviews. Originality cannot replace a good script.
46e57#$sw%%62$45@
This movie was awful. I came in very excited based on user reviews but it became clear that all of these people must have been on drugs. The movie is wacky but not in a good way, with seemingly random things happening.I was just waiting for it to be over and if I was not with friends would have walked out of the cinema.The one positive I can give it is that it is very original and that is not common in Hollywood nowadays.Don't be swayed by all the positive reviews, this movie is not worth it.
46e57#$sw%%62$45@
Did I watch a different movie? The entire beginning was a fast-paced convoluted mess of nonsense, that was also difficult to understand in between the fast subtitles and fast broken English. Sure, the story was unique, but all the attempt at humor was a fail, and thus made the story feel infantile. As for the acting, everyone was pretty much annoying except for Michelle Yeoh, of whom seemed to be the only one working her butt off. It's a very generous 6/10 from me.

Everyone is in awe of the Emperor's fine new clothes. How stylish they are! How magnificent! How artful and clever! The truth is of course that the Emperor has no new clothes. He's buck naked or if he's dressed at all it's in hand-me-down rags and remnants borrowed from others. But whisper it who dare lest they be thought a doofus, a philistine.Let's just grasp the nettle here. This is a bad film. It's completely uninspired, using old sf concepts as if they were somehow original or clever. The actors try their best but have so little to work with that they come across as talentless hams which I'm sure they're not. No, the responsibilty for this mess lies with the director and the writers. The only people this will impress are those who have never read or watched intelligent science fiction and obviously there are a lot of them out there.Such a boring movie and it feels so bloody long and good films never seem long. You never want them to end but with this one you wish it had never started.

Non stop action and laughs the whole way through. Everything Everywhere All At Once is the movie that you need to see if you want a great cinematic experience. In my opinion I think this is as good possible better than No Way Home. I loved the acting in this as well.The way that the directors filmed this movie was also genius. The whole concept of the film was brilliant. Jamie Lee Curtis was also phenomenal as always. This film was just absolutely stunning to watch and to look at. Easily one of the best films of the year so far.

My palms were sweaty even after the movie was over. This movie was very predictable and you get what you expect just from the trailer. But this is still a terrifying fun film. There are a couple of curve balls thrown at you that I really appreciated. Very fun to watch!
46e57#$sw%%62$45@
This movie was rather hard to watch, not because of the direction or acting, but just because of the sheer intensity of the story. It's not for the weak of heart. I wanted to look away several times rather than see what was going to happen. It's a pretty decent film, just know that if you're squeamish or acrophobic at all, you're probably going to be on the edge of your seat the whole time, probably not feeling too comfortable at times.

Greetings again from the darkness. If you've ever wondered what a recurring nightmare would look like if filmed for the big screen, writer-director Scott Mann (HEIST, 2015) and co-writer Jonathan Frank are here to show you. Not much plot exists, and the bulk of the movie consists of two characters stuck in one place. Sounds pretty simple, right? Well I can tell you that my palms were sweaty and the tension was high.The opening sequence immediately evokes memories of the spectacular documentary FREE SOLO (2018) featuring expert climber Alex Hannold. Becky (Grace Caroline Currey, SHAZAM!, 2019), her husband Dan (Mason Gooding, SCREAM, 2022), and their friend Hunter (Virginia Gardner, HALLOWEEN, 2018) are climbing the face of a mountain when tragedy strikes. We then flash forward 51 weeks and find Becky is a still-grieving recluse drowning her sorrows in booze and contemplating suicide. We aren't clued in as to how she has paid rent for the past year, but her frustrated dad (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) has had no luck getting her to "move on", and has called Hunter in to see if she can motivate Becky to rejoin society.Hunter's big idea is for the two ladies to climb the 2000-foot tall B67 TV Tower, once billed as the tallest structure in the U. S., but now a long-abandoned relic. Hunter is the risk-taker of the two, and she has developed quite a following on her YouTube channel by filming her own risky stunts. The tower appears to be out in some desert just beyond a sign that warns, "No Trespassing - Danger of Death." Terrific camera work shows us the loose bolts, shaky tension lines, and rusty ladder once used for tower maintenance. In fact, the terrific camera work and the performances of the two actors are what drive home the terror we feel once they have reached the top and realize there is no way down. If your acrophobia hasn't shaken you enough, how about being stranded 2000 feet above the ground on a platform barely large enough for two people to sit? Your choices for dying include falling, dehydration, starvation, exposure, or being pecked by the local vultures attracted to the injuries sustained while climbing.Resourcefulness involves cell phones with no reception, a pair of Chuck Taylors, a flare gun, and a new use for a sports bra ... somehow hardly noticeable once it's gone. The two climbers are trapped for most of the run time, turning this into quite a survival story. Mind games and psychology play a part once exhaustion sets in, and there are couple of twists, neither of which should surprise most viewers. While the tension created is commendable, one recurring irritant became a bit of a joke - the overuse of "Are you okay?" begins in the opening sequence and seems to be repeated every 4-6 minutes. If it were a drinking game, no viewer would remain conscious by the end of the film. Other than that, it's one of the better cinematic versions of a nightmare you're likely to find ... plus it leaves us with the inspiration: "If you're scared of dying, don't be afraid to live."Opens in theaters August 12, 2022.

3 out of 5 stars.Fall is a fair survival film. About two girls Becky (Grace Caroline Currey) and Hunter (Virginia Gardner) after a mountain climbing accident. Leaves Becky in a depressed state. Hunter tries to take Becky to get over her fears by taking her to the tallest tower. So they can do a simple climb. Only once on top the ladder falls apart and they are stuck at the very top.Plot is a bit cliche. The script and characters are written to be dumb. The film is thrilling when the girls are high on the tower. Trying to get down without falling to there deaths.

LIKES:Fast Runtime: With a lot of experimental films, directors sometimes lose their ability to tell the story in a short amount of time and go to the three hour mark. Fortunately, Fall is not one of those films, doing very well to handle the entire ordeal in rough 84 minutes. The pacing is decent, finding good ways to utilize the moment to get character development while also keeping the suspenseful element strong. It's a nice mixture of the two elements and helps bring at least decent representation of both thrills and drama spills.Great Musical Score: This movie is one of those where music really makes a difference at those key elements. Fall may not have the biggest or most unique track list, but it utilizes the limited song title quite well to really add the finesse and inspiration these scores do. Cherry Pie as a casual rock out moment and then as an inspiration cheer was quite fun and a good connecting point. While orchestral scores make up those killer finishing shots that are amazing across the board. There is not much I can say pass this, but perhaps Fall will at least make you want to listen to the 80s song again.Message Is Powerful: So many movies these days are about delivering that gigantic message to hopefully inspire the "change" that we all "need." Fall has a couple of deep messages that do well to display some important topics, and most of them are pretty good. There is some trauma, no surprise right as these movies go, and how to handle these moments or at least the mindset some face, is decently glimpses in this film. Other moments like facing the fears, the will to survive, and pushing yourself are very big in this film, and there is surprising wisdom and class in the dialogue and filming to really show this message. It's target audience in particular should be inspired the most and find the words in particular worthy of being on your social media quotes.Acting Is Good: This movie heavily focuses on two characters and the actresses are the ones to hold much of the attention of the film. Let's get this out of the way, they are very attractive, one the bosom blonde with that fiery energy, the other one delicate gorgeous and sensitive. With those superficial components out of the way, the girls are very good at displaying the qualities you need for this very focused movie. Morgan, for what little he is in it, does well with his time, and manages to deliver his few lines with fantastic abilities. Gardner is vibrant and playing the typical thriller type woman you see in these films. She's bold, she brings the one liners and meme looks that modern generations love, and of course representing the new generation of humans. She's bold, she talks a lot, and yet has some deeper layers that come out as the film progresses to help break the superficial mirror a bit. Yet it's Currey who claims my vote for best acting. As Becky, she really brings so many qualities that I grasped onto, her story deeper, more developed, and more realistic to help round out the character. Most of her acting is solid and sincere, and was the character that annoyed me the least with the direction that they took. Well done!The Makeup: You can guess that trouble does eventually ensue if you have seen the trailers, which means the potential to suffer from the consequences. Fall is all about making the suffering look real, the make-up and effects solid as the girls gradually look dehydrated, exhausted and exposed to the element. It adds that suspense and experience effect, really selling to me just how miserable something like this would be if it happened. And when other things happen, they pull out some impressive tricks to make it believable.Great Presentation: I can't say much about this, but let's just say that this presentation was solid for telling the story they wanted. Fall does a great job of laying out the story, and plotting out gradual transition of this journey, bringing things into a gradual build up to again help keep that attempt at suspense going. It is mostly very natural, and the editing solid to deliver so much in such a short amount of time. And when the climax hits, all the effects come together to finish the thrill ride in that last drop.The Cinematography: My favorite part of the whole movie, the cinematography is key to what makes this movie the spectacle it is. This film really pulled a lot of tricks to make the tower look as foreboding as it should be. MacGregor finds all the right angle to get the scene going, from upward shots of the tower, to the angles looking down the valley below to establish the magnitude of the climb. Then he takes it one step further finding the perfect shot to continue showing everything the girls are experiencing including: close ups of them really struggling, the dynamic angle changes as they dangle from ropes and the fleeting shots as they try to solve their predicaments. For so many movie pieces, MacGregor, and the editing team afterwards, really brings it all together to give you the Thriller element without the shaky camera. And then there are other moments I can't share that help immerse me into the movie, helping give that overall picture of what they are doing. I can't say much more, so let's move to my limitations for this movie.DISLIKES:More Morgan: Let's face it. He's a top billed actor and there is more we could have done with the talent that Morgan can bring. Whether more time at the beginning, more integration into the other's life, or even shots of him trying to find them would have been welcome. These moments would have integrated the story a little better, and brought that extra angle to help the solution be a little more realistic than what they did. Though, the solution is definitely unique.More Story Needed: There were so many avenues to explore for the two girls being on the tower as long as they were. Fall had a very big opportunity to utilize the secrets they were holding and gradually reveal how deep the rabbit hole went. While from a time sake they hit the highlights, from another element they skimped on helping further explore the motifs they were trying to present. Having Morgan's character involved could have given even more to give these girls the best depth possible.Animal Cruelty I did not Need to See: Animal cruelty is potentially something I do not like to see. I can handle if it has a purpose, and for one of them it did work for the sake of the story. However, an early scene showed something I don't enjoy seeing and could have been edited out or done a different way. Does it accomplish the horror, foreshadowing, and mood to come? Yep, but again, it crosses a line for me.Some In your Face Dialogue That's Cheesy: One thing that modern writers seem to have to do is rub the dialogue in your face to prove the point. Much of the dialogue was either okay or good, but there are other moments, particularly at the beginning, and some of Hunter's dialogue, that is really grueling. Like out of a book of Full House, the "inspirational" comes out a bit cheesy and I was just waiting for the actions to finally prove what the words could not do for me. I don't know if it was the writing, the direction, or the acting, perhaps all three, but those in your face moments did not work for me. Again, I think the target audience in this aspect will love it, enjoying the theatrics that really blow it up. But goers like me, may pray for something better and just bite their tongues to get by it.Stupidity and Suspense of Disbelief Get A Little Out of Hand: One thing that is tough to avoid in these movies, is the various actions that occur to get the characters into the mess. Champion thrillers for me, are the ones that know how to craft it organically, but Fall's case follows the trend of our characters being stupid. The level of stupidity is kind of extreme, a bit insulting given the lessons they already learned. I mean climbing a rusted, banned tower for thrills... really that is the plot. Then as things progress, you see just how poor one of the characters is, and how stupid they seem to selectively be to push them to have to MacGyver up some quick fix solutions. Those moments are kind of too much for me, and could have changed the movie big time if they had just taken their own advice to save them trouble. And, the series of unfortunate events that happens gets a little ridiculous at times to the point of the stroke of bad luck being a tad too much. It hits comic relief and helps drag out the thrills, but at times I was like, I just predicted that would happen and you did it. This adds more cheese factor to the movie and was probably the biggest frustration of the film for me.The VERDICT:Fall was a bit deeper than I had anticipated from the trailers and cast. It blends elements of other thriller films in this category, and expands past the sorority girl motif to give us better characters. The messages are strong, the presentation and layout linear and decently paced, with acting that helps craft a better quality situation than what we got. Of course it's the visual and sound effects, including music, that really make the movie as intense as it is, with a fantastic blend of shots edited together to stir up any acrophobia you might have. With all the good, the movie needed ironically a little more time to fully flesh out the characters, alongside adding more time with Morgan's character as well. Fall's biggest limitation for me though is the cheese factor and how stupid the movie went sometimes. While some of the idiocy is relieved, there are other times where the lack of logic is mind blowing given the plan they had mentioned five seconds before it. Overall though, worthy of a theater visit for the effects, while definitely a recommendation to watch at home.My scores are:Thriller: 7.0
Movie Overall 6.0.

Great and very tense movie all the way through! I highly recommend this to any thrill seeker who loves heights and not afraid to be up high and try new daring things! Very crazy movie from start to finish!
46e57#$sw%%62$45@
8/10! If you enjoyed the movie The Shallows with Blake Lively this is essentially the same vibes but instead of out in the water with the shark you are 2,000 feet up high stranded with vultures. Great acting, story and feels with this one and a major shocker for me I didn't see coming. Had a good ending to, I def recommend it!

Fall is the kind of movie that's A) best the first time you see it and B) is most effective in theaters-the bigger the screen the better.A lot of scenes genuinely made me feel the jelly legs you get from vertigo at great heights. The tension and escalating desperation was really well shot-it was an enjoyable ride. I don't see Fall being as effective streaming at home or watching on a small screen or mobile device.The plot twist (which is satisfying on a first watch) probably won't hit as hard in subsequent viewings, and it's not compelling enough to make me want to rewatch the movie with the knowledge of the twist to spot clues and details.

Plot twist... check
Action.... check
Relatable characters... check
Nothing to complain about.If you like thrillers &amp; you like suspense, this is a more than adequate movie.

FALL is quite an exciting movie that will scare you especially if you have a fear of height. This thriller can really thrill you from the start till end. A running time of 107 mins might be a tad too long for such a simplistic premise, but the film maker managed to inject quite a lot of close-shave situations and some back stories. Many of the decisions made by the characters are believable and logical. There is a little twist toward the end (but I am not going to spoil it). I find that this twist strengthened the plot even more. I am satisfied with this movie. From those YouTube comments on its trailers, many did not highly of this movie. Let me tell you, you will change your mind after you watched it. The cast did a good job and acted very well. Watch it at a big screen cinemas if possible; your palms will be sweaty I bet of you.

From a plot standpoint, Fall bears striking similarity to another film from this year, The Ledge. But in most respects, Fall is a far superior film.For one thing, the visual effects and backgrounds in Fall are remarkably convincing. I wasn't afraid of heights before this film, but my throat dropped into my gut many times as the perilous situation unfolded.The performances in Fall add to the authenticity as these two actresses really do feel like best friends who care about each other. I believed that they cared, and that made me care.Makeup is also an element that they succeeded at here; as the days tick by and the girls have no food or water, they really do look like they're on the brink of death. And it's brutal to see.Contained thrillers are very difficult to write because there is only so much one can do to keep up both stakes and emotional investment in one setting. For the most part, this film succeeds. Drama between the girls unfolds in a sometimes heartbreaking, believable way and the times when they try to save themselves from their dire predicament are always tensely executed.What really didn't work for me was the implausibility of the girls' occasional obliviousness. Given how many days they are sitting in the same place, stuck, it's insane how long it takes for them to come up with some solutions to their present danger, and how many solutions there are that they don't come up with.But I can overlook most of this. After all, people are flawed, and judgment is skewed in the face of danger. These aren't plot holes; they're just writing conveniences that at times annoyed me personally.Still, the film is so well-acted, well-shot, well-paced, and compelling from a character perspective that I am thoroughly impressed with this as a contained thriller. It's one of the better thrillers we've gotten this year.

Movies that make my palms sweaty and force me to hold in my bladder deserve some recognition. I enjoyed both actresses from other horror movies so seeing them was a treat. Great movie to see in the theaters, definitely will watch again. I hope there's some good special features explaining the making of on the blu ray.
46e57#$sw%%62$45@
If this movie does one thing well, it's building tension. There was times I was on the edge of my seat, clinched and sweaty, just imagining being up on that tower myself.This is far from a, what I would call, a "critically good" movie. The visuals aren't top notch, especially in the beginning, but becomes more forgivable after the first scene, some of the dialogue and actions of the characters might make you scratch your head, and there are some major plot points that some might find to be predictable. The ending does feel pretty abrupt and I feel like we missed a couple good scenes on the cutting room floor in favor of run time.All that being said, if you're a huge fan of survival thriller movies in the vein of 47 Meters Down, Frozen, etc. You would certainly have a good time with this flick. It does an excellent job of keeping you on edge throughout the whole movie, which is quite a feat, and something I haven't felt in a theater in awhile. It certainly has its flaws but it entertains remarkably well.

Really enjoyed the thrill ride from Fall. The trailer looked good.. and the full film didn't disappoint. Super exciting and keeps you on the edge of your seat. Story did have some weak points and some stuff that didn't make as much sense.. but it still worked and kept me engaged the entire time. Was really exciting seeing it in the theater. Good film!
46e57#$sw%%62$45@
An almost perfectly delivered night at the cinema.The thrills and scares are fantastic - real edge of your seat stuff.Some of the script is repurposed from other "oh no what are we going to do" movies but given the quality of the overall package this can be forgiven.Perfect date night movie!

This was the movie that increased my anxiety and heartbeat to its peak and the sweat in my palm. I can't describe how much I enjoyed this movie. Felt like I was the soul of the actress at the top of that tower. My tall height anxiety reached its peak. What a wonderful cast and very straightforward story with no lagging no steep downs, and no extra breakdowns. Undoubtedly worth watching it.
46e57#$sw%%62$45@
I'm not big on heights in any case, but this movie stressed me out in the best way possible. There are the obligatory "don't do that!" Instances, but solid acting and some terrifying moments - heightened by the excellent cinematography. I was moved to close my eyes an embarrassing amount of times. Entertaining!
46e57#$sw%%62$45@
Wow! Okay! I didn't see the trailer for this and kind of just went to see it out of the blue and I was blown away by this movie. I was a big fan of the horror movie Frozen and haven't seen much else like it since then. This is a movie you want to see at the theater on the big screen. It has to be in my top ten best theater experiences. INTENSE! Makes you feel like you are there with them! Not once did I think about what time it was or when it was going to end. I was just there in the present. I can't remember the last time I went to the theater and got an adrenaline rush. Out of pure luck I chose this one to watch and I'm so glad I did. See it on the largest screen you can and sit in the second row, you won't be disappointed.
46e57#$sw%%62$45@
Negan was the best thing in this movie and he was barely in it. Felt like Jeffery Dean Morgan was still playing the same character; aside from him the rest of the cast wasn't so great and the script didn't help. It had a lot of cliché quotes and one liners. It also had the similar concept to Adrift with Shailene Woodley, just not nearly as good. I knew it'd be hard to make an interesting story out of two girls stuck at the top of a tower; they tried adding a back story to it with a predictable plot twist but it really didn't do much. What you see in the trailer is basically what happens in the movie. I had such low expectations that I was actually expecting to be surprised since that's what happened with a recent movie I watched, Vengeance, but it ended up not exceeding expectations. It has a lot of unrealistic scenes too, I don't think it's that serious but all these blemishes add up. Both the actresses and their characters's writing weren't good enough because it's a movie that leans on them to be charismatic and make the audience root for them. Nearly 2hrs long and that feels too long to just watch someone stuck on a ledge. I don't want to call it a bad movie though, there just wasn't a lot of wiggle room to begin with for the writers to make this that much more interesting.
46e57#$sw%%62$45@
The movie dragged on a bit but there were definitely intense moments, I mean you can't do much on top of a tower so what do you expect! This definitely kept you on the edge of your seat at moments ;).
46e57#$sw%%62$45@
This reminded me of a few films such as The Blair Witch Project, The Shallows, and of course both 47 Meters Down movies.Is this a bad thing?No, not at all.Most people in the theater watching this more than likely liked if not loved those films.I enjoyed them all.I enjoyed this movie.You know exactly what you're getting and you get what you pay for with Fall.As with any action-adventure thriller there are going to have to be suspensions of.disbelief from the audience during different scenes.A simple question I had is, if these ladies are such expert climbers or extreme athletes, then why don't they take on this challenge while wearing either gloves or utilizing climbing powder?You're going to sweat. It's hot. You're in the elements. Adrenaline at a full tilt.I had sweaty palms just watching them. They're the ones climbing that rickety, rusty stuff. They're not going to wear any sort of gloves, or use anything for grip?No way!It makes no sense. But there I go, asking questions when I just need to go along for the climb.There's a good twist at the end.You've seen it before but it works here too.Fall is enjoyable in the theater, and I recommend it for the sheer anxiety it will bring forth on the big screen.Though I know now how it all ends, I'd love to watch it again sometime, even on a smaller screen.

My first ever movie review because it was that good. Can't detail much about the later half of the movie without spoilers but if you're even remotely considering seeing it GO TO THE THEATER I promise if you love thrillers you'll enjoy it. Excellent acting and never a dull moment the entire movie with incredible curveballs!
46e57#$sw%%62$45@
Id like to preface this review by saying I have not seen many of the other movies of this kind with a couple of characters stranded in one location for the entire movie. Im aware that this type of plot is basicslly its own subgenre at this point and Fall was my introduction into it, and I loved it from beginning to end. I watched it twice (as I always do before reviewing a movie) and it definitely has rewatchability down. This movie follows 2 girls Becky and Hunter who climb the 4th tallest structure in America to get over the loss of their friend who died in a tragic climbing accident, but once they make it to the top of the tower the ladder breaks leaving them stranded atop the 20,000 foot tall tower. The first 20 minutes or so are dedicated to getting us to this point, but the next hour and a half is just attempt after attempt to get off this tower, and its very suspenseful. I watched this as a person with a fear of heights, and with my friend who is a rock climber, and we were able to appreciate it in different ways because of that. I loved the suspense of the whole film and my friend was able to relate to it because he was familiar with every fear the characters were feeling. Theres not much to talk about when it comes to the bulk of the movie, its all very interesting but the biggest talking point I have with this film is the plot twistSo in the film they lose their bag on some sort of dish off the side of the tower that isn't very far below them but without a ladder they can't reach it. At a certain point they devise a plan and hunter goes to retrieve it. She successfully reaches the dish, hooks the bag on the rope she climbed down with, and tries to climb back up, but right before she makes it to the top she slips and falls back down. Now were shown that she survives and makes it back up, but near the very end of the movie its revealed that she actually did die in that fall, and her appearance from that point forward in the film was all in Becky's head. When I first saw this it got my heart racing and it didn't stop till well after I walked out of the theater. But on my second time around I noticed the insane amount of clues they snuck in there alluding to the fact she isn't actually there.The first and most obvious hint is the fact that after she dies hunter never does anything, all the actual actions taken to aid their survival and rescue were performed by Becky. Secondly, the night after she dies, Becky has a nightmare where she sees hunters corpse right next to her being eaten by vultures, and when she wakes up she's comforted by hunter telling her it was just a bad dream and everything is ok, when in reality this is just her brain trying to comfort herself because hunter did actually die and the dream was a response to that. Third, hunter never shows emotion after she dies, all her dialogue is just supportive words to Becky, she never shows anger, sadness, or worry, she's just a vessel of optimism for Becky because Becky is just creating this vision of her to keep her going. Fourth, when Becky tries to charge her drone with a light bulb thats above them, she drops her bag of supplies and hunter just watches it fall, and when Becky asks why she didn't catch it hunter has no response. 5th, this is more of an extention of #3 but when she flies the drone to send a note and it gets hit by a truck, Becky is devastated, she bursts into tears, she loses all hope, but hunter has 0 reaction. 6th, when Becky begins to dose off and lose consciousness due to hunger, hunter tries to keep her mind occupied by having Becky name her favorite wrestlers, but when Becky can't remember the name of one of her favorites, hunter helps her out by providing the correct answer, but as Becky reveals right after this line, hunter never watched wrestling. All these are perfectly placed subtle giveaways that hunter isn't actually here anymore. But my favorite thing out of every hint is the fact that when hunter falls to her death, you can hear her body hit the dish, even tho visually we see she "survives"this movie has an amazing sense of setup and payoff, it feels almost every line in this movie is a setup to some later plot point, the light at the diner, the unnamed "special someone" in one of hunters old pictures, the vultures, the drone, the Instagram likes, everything that happens before the characters reach the top of the tower is some sort of setup for some revalation later that just might help out characters survive. Its suspenseful, its compelling, its well written, the visuals are fantastic, and its just fun to watch. The only minor complaint I have with the film is that when its revealed hunter was dead all along, the dialogue isn't the best. Its very good in the beginning of the scene but once hunter says "im down there" and the big reveal hits you, she continues to exposit rather than dissipating from the plot right then and there. The moment would've been much more effective had the reveal of what actually happened all along be visual past this point but instead we have the apparition of hunter say things along the lines of "you just couldn't handle the fact I really died" and "you didn't really think your scrawny a** could pull me up did you?" and it sours the moment a little because it feels very unnatural. Also its very clear this used to be an R rated film with the amount of times they say "freaking" instead of just using the F word but it had to be censored to get that pg13 rating. But these are the only complaints I have with the entire film and I dont think these are substantial enough for me to deduct a star from the score. Overall a fantastic movie, and unless you're a child or you'll vomit at the sight of heights or blood, id 100% reccomend you check this film out.

I saw Fall, starring Grace Caroline Currey-Shazam!, Annabelle:Creation; Virginia Gardner-Runaways_tv, Halloween_2018; Mason Gooding-Scream_2022, Ballers_tv and Jeffrey Dean Morgan-The Walking Dead_tv, Red Dawn_2012.If you are afraid of heights, you should probably not see this movie. It looks thrilling and pretty realistic but the story is fairly mediocre. Grace and Mason are a married couple that love to climb mountains with their friend Virginia. After Mason dies in a climbing incident, Grace starts spiraling into depression and drinking heavily. Jeffrey plays Grace's father who she pushes away after he tries to console her. After about a year, Virginia convinces Grace to get back on the horse-get back to living her life-and climb a 2,000 foot tall radio tower. She resists at first but eventually gives in, thinking that she could spread Mason's ashes at the top of the tower. Of course, things go wrong and they get stranded at the top. Like I said, it looks great but there is a lot of tired cliches in the story line.It's rated PG-13 for language, bloody images and intense peril and has a running time of 1 hour &amp; 47 minutes.I don't know if I would buy it on DVD but it would be a good rental-if you don't get vertigo.

This movie consists mostly of us watching previously known characters doing whatever theyre doing now, meandering nowhere plot wise, while getting in random tight spots . For some reason they believed fans want to see a repeat of 1st movie and its characters instead of a new quality story and interesting content. Also EVERY SINGLE tight spot they find themselves in with dinosaurs is same formula.Its always exactly as it has been in every Jurassic film. Big problem all of a sudden, slow moving dino watching someone or breathing around them, then dino gives chase, uff! They barely escaped but escape they did!It is so dull and predicatable.Meanwhile we meet two new types of characters, a) those who are just inherently evil b) those who do evil stuff but are really good and moral. You can tell them apart easily by looking at what theyre wearing and whether its a rich straight white guy.The story is dumb and their evil plan so on the nose it is humorous. Zero imagination when writing the script. The length of it fits on half a napkin.After 80% of the movie is finished and we have gone over the revisiting our "favourite" Jurassic characters and our classic Jurassic scenes phase, the predictable ending occurs.And you realize the movie was as a wonderful and full of quality content as a dino fart.
46e57#$sw%%62$45@
Bad script, bad acting, stupid story, a new dinosaur every 5 minutes, too long, no suspense, Chris Pratt doing the hand thing, $160 million dollar budget for this, so many pointless dinosaur fights AND you took 2 and a half hours to tell me this garbage story.Frankly embarrassing to everyone involved.
46e57#$sw%%62$45@
If I were to list out all the things this movie focuses on, dinosaurs would be fifth or sixth, behind multiple storylines that range from bland to useless. I'm baffled by how little focus is on dinosaurs. And I don't just mean they are barely onscreen. The original Jurassic Park barely had any for the first hour. But everything leading up to that, the story, dialogue and themes, were all focused on dinosaurs.That's not the case with Dominion. The majority of the storylines are tangentially related at best, completely unrelated at worst. Imagine watching Taken but Liam Neeson has to watch out for dinosaurs... that's one storyline. You could replace dinosaurs with any scary creatures and it would make little difference to the plot.On top of that, they did a poor job of balancing so many storylines with different characters. Or maybe it's because every single one is uninteresting. And the moment when the different characters come together falls completely flat. I compare it to Stranger Things, when the stories converge and the crew is finally together, those moments are so impactful and exciting. They feel earned and elevate everything after. In Dominion, you don't feel any kind of magic.Some parts were so bad they made me cringe or roll my eyes. But that wasn't the case for the majority of the movie. So why such a harsh score? Because this movie, which is the definition of a popcorn flick here to entertain us, is unbelievably boring. I had 8 hours of sleep last night and drank a Red Bull, yet I was struggling to stay awake. I had to un-recline.All of the action scenes are forgettable. Literally. It's only been a few hours and I can remember maybe a couple cool moments. And one thing I couldn't believe, the climax action sequence is straight-up copied from one of the previous movies. I won't say which one, but I'm baffled they went this route. It's even sadder when you realize it's worse than what it copied in every way.As for the dinosaur effects, at times the animatronic dinosaurs look like toys. And the CGI dinosaurs look a bit off. I don't think it's poor CGI but something about it doesn't feel right.I am so disappointed this is what they gave us for their self-proclaimed "epic conclusion of the Jurassic era." Especially after Fallen Kingdom left us with such an exciting cliffhanger, the chaos that awaits the people of the world when dinosaurs are unleashed upon them. That's not at all what we get.I loved the first Jurassic World. And while the second is highly flawed, it's still entertaining and filled with tension and suspense. I felt none of that with Dominion.

Before I went to this film (because my Grandson is nuts about this series of films) I read one newspaper review. It wasn't glowing, but it was positive. Unfortunately, this is a mess. Others have already talked about the issues I have. Granted, this is an empty headed summer movie, it could still have been done with some serious thought. I was hanging in there throughout with a new dinosaur attack every three minutes, and velociraptors going at fifty miles per hour and not getting tired. Humans being assaulted time after time and yet showing no fatigue. I also didn't see a scratch on any of them. But the best of all was the promise made to a baby dinosaur and his mother that precluded saving the world from famine. Not to mentioned the coincidences of everyone showing up in just the right places. I still don't understand how they got into that facility so easily. The return of the original cast was not helpful other than Jeff Goldblum's sarcasm. Anyway, it's all been said. This is a poor movie.

-Dinousaurs that only survived in warm climates can apparently thrive in cold winter climates-Between the time-span of the last movie several dinousaurs have quickly evolved into partial birds-You can effectively lasso an 8000lb Parasaurolophous on horseback-Velociraptors can get perfect traction running uphill in the snow-Velociraptors will chase you on a motorcycle at 50mph for several miles without tiring or considering going after the many pedestrians on foot along the way-Baryonyx; a dinosaur most paleontologists conclude hunted fish with it's long arms will devour a grown man-The "Bird Raptor" dinosaur can swim 50mph underwater and has perfect vision for hunting underwater even though it probably couldn't swim at all-A system put in place specifically to extinguish all of your contained giant locusts only serves to make them escape and continue to live on fire as long as it looks cool for the audience and is convenient to the "plot"-Mosasaurus a giant predatory aquatic reptile is affectionate towards whales instead of eating them when it serves the "feel good" ending-Instead of doing proper fan service to the series, completely abandon the Jurassic Park universe and instead copy Star Wars, The Bourne Identity, Mission Impossible and X-Files then throw dinosaurs in there for good measure!

When I go to a Jurassic Park movie, I want something above all else-hyper realistic dinosaurs in cool environments, seeing them frolic in natural habitat, defend territory, battle other dinos for dominance, hunt humans, and the like. From the opening island scene with the brachiosaurus to the T-Rex reveal in the rainstorm, dinosaurs were front and center in the original Jurassic Park, inspiring a sense of grandeur and awe. The dinosaurs were what mattered, and everything else was peripheral-even the plot to get off the island. We all wanted another glimpse of the T-Rex, or were anxious to discover where the raptors were lurking.So that was the first one. Now in this sixth installment, not only are dinosaurs relegated to a commercialized product that's seen on every tv screen in the movie, but they're demoted below the humans, genetics, and even mutated locusts in terms of importance. In a two and a half hour movie, one would expect dinosaurs to fill almost half that time, and yet they pale in screen time comparison to all the human characters. Instead, the director tried to insert cameos of the legacy characters in forced interactions and honestly cringey dialogue, shifting the focus away from the real meaning in the Jurassic Park franchise-awe for dinosaurs. The wonder is now gone.I have given it six stars in respect for the franchise and the limited appearances of some of my favorite dinosaurs, but I'm sad to see that the director forgot what made Jurassic Park so special in the first place.

This movie attempts to exploit the nostalgia of the original characters and it fails miserably at every level. The action, the editing, the direction, it's all terrible. The movie has no focus, too many characters that have nothing to do and nothing to do with each other. The only positive thing I can say about this movie is they did use plenty of "real" props for some of the dinosaurs, so it's not like the actors are always looking at a green screen. However, everyone just feels kind of disconnected from the movie. Like everyone involved knew the script was trash and the movie would just be a cash grab because they knew idiots like myself would go and see it. Oh well. Just Hollywood doing what they do best.

Colin Trevorrow was so preoccupied with weather he could squeeze all his ideas into a film, he didn't stop to think if he should try and squeeze them all into his film. The narrative is so overstuffed it would fill a Mosasaurus, the action frustratingly lacks any kind of tension, horror or real threat to the main characters and the occasional call backs seen in JW and JW:FK are now as subtle as a sledgehammer to the face. That's not to say its a bad film, there's some excellent character moments with the original cast and Jeff Goldblum is brilliant, injecting some much needed humour into this otherwise pretty dry sequel. Being a huge JP fan, this could simply be a case of high expectations getting the better of me but the lack of exhilaration and awe upon leaving the cinema is painful.

Honestly, I could have adapted any number of great Dr. Malcolm quotes from the other films to title this review, but this one perhaps sums it up best. (Be warned. I have a lot to say, so if you dislike long reviews, skip ahead now.)Here's where I'm coming from:1. Loved Jurassic Park, of course.2. Enjoyed Lost World but disappointed by its missed potential.3. LIKED Jurassic Park III (that's right, I'm the guy).4. Admired Jurassic World for recreating some of the awe of the original with a slight twist.5. Frustrated with Fallen Kingdom's disjointed structure and simplistic characters but its cliffhanger ending left me optimistic for the future.6. Dominion... Well, another Malcolm quote sums it up: "That is one big pile of s**t."The Jurassic World trilogy unfortunately has been one of diminishing returns. The first (JW) was a reimaging of the 1993 original (not unlike The Force Awakens was to A New Hope), but with an understanding of modern cynicism and apathy. An early line of dialogue summed up the theme: "No one is impressed by a dinosaur anymore." Genetically creating a new scarier hybrid dinosaur was an interesting angle, as it kept the scientific focus of the original but provided a meta commentary not just on the JP franchise but on all Hollywood monster movies. While it was no masterpiece, Colin Trevorrow gave a new idea to ponder alongside the dinos, which neither Lost World nor JP III did.Fallen Kingdom was very messy. Since JW resolved its plot quite well, new storylines and characters were created out of thin air, and logic was pretty much thrown out the window. John Hammond had a partner? The island houses an active volcano? Human cloning going back years? Claire now works for PETA for dinosaurs? The last surviving raptor is John McClane? A Freddy Krueger like dinosaur was created that hunts children in their beds for the purpose of...military combat? Yet, for all of Fallen Kingdom's problems, J. A. Bayona at least gave us some new atmosphere and ended on an intriguing note. By releasing the dinosaurs into the mainland, the door was left open for a number of interesting directions to take the final film.What's baffling about Dominion is how it manages, at great effort, to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory (pardon the pun). It was supposed to be the franchise's grand denouement. The set up was there--a fastball down the middle --and instead of a homer they hit a long popup to left field while the audience waits with increasing disappointment for the inevitable catch. I didn't care to research what went wrong with Dominion's planning process, but I wouldn't be surprised if there were multiple scripts with different ideas, and Trevorrow (back in the director's chair, and again one of the writers) decided "let's use them all!...except for the one that examines the logistics of dinosaurs living amongst humans...that one can be trashed."As other reviewers have discussed, dinosaurs are merely tangential to Dominion's messy plot. For much of the 2 1/2 hour runtime, it's easy to forget about them, since instead the film decides to focus on...the human characters (and locusts?). Aside from the original, the JP movies have had a consistent problem with its human roles, most either being annoying, doing inexplicably stupid things (even the good guys, Nick Van Owen, anyone?), or just being plain boring. It's the last one that hurts Dominion the most.In JW, Owen (Pratt) and Claire (Howard) were stereotypical but capable leads with some humorous interactions. Fallen Kingdom stripped away most of Owen's charisma and gave Claire's personality an unwelcome 180. In Dominion, Owen is now Generic Action Hero, and Claire has made a full transformation from Take-Charge Corporate Executive to a worried mother (over a child who isn't hers) who screams and panics a lot with Dr. Ellie Sattler (Dern) when encountering bugs. So much for women inherit the earth. Maisie (Sermon) also returns from Fallen Kingdom. Sadly, instead of focusing on her grappling with being the first human clone, they've reduced her to an unlikeable angsty teen who serves as a MacGuffin for the others after she's kidnapped by the bad guys for reasons not entirely clear.Bringing back the original cast is pointless if you give them nothing interesting to do. Dr. Grant (Neill) is perhaps the saddest case. In the 20 years since we've last seen him he is still digging up dinosaur fossils and apparently has done nothing else with his life. He has fallen from an intelligent, capable leader to a clueless figure who mostly follows others around looking as confused and bored as the audience. Dern as Dr. Sattler fares the best; she is given the most to do and tries to inject life into the nonsensical plot. Goldblum as Dr. Malcolm is a welcome return, but our favorite nonconformist chaotician would NEVER go work for a genetics lab. Near the film's end he provides an amusing commentary on the movie's absurdity (e.g., his deadpan to Pratt: "You made a promise to a dinosaur?")Two more returning roles need mention. One of the more interesting things JW and Fallen Kingdom did was bring back Dr. Wu (B. D. Wong), making him a brilliant but self-indulgent geneticist. Wong sold it very well and it seemed like a natural progression for his character. He felt Hammond never gave him the respect he deserved (like Nedry), so he became determined to make bigger and greater accomplishments (i.e., hybrid monsters) than his former boss, unabashedly and at any cost. It was an interesting heel turn, making Dr. Wu (while never a major role) the most believable human antagonist of the series. Instead of resolving Wu's villainous arc, Dominion inexplicably reverses course and strips him of his hubris. Looking ungodly sick, Wu gives a mea culpa to Maisie for his creation of...giant locusts. No mention of his regret for recklessly creating the hybrid killing machines in the last two movies. Another good set-up from prior movies wasted.And then there's Dr. Dodgson (Scott). JP enthusiasts will remember the character's cameo in the first JP as the competing geneticist who hires Nedry to steal the embryos. And true fans know he played a more prominent role in the second novel. It seemed like an inspired choice to bring back Dodgson, a villain who connects to the plot of the first film and, by proxy, to its three returning heroes. Yet, in his interactions in Dominion with Sattler, Grant, and Malcolm, they never learn of his involvement in JP. Indeed, even Dodgson doesn't seem aware that they were involved in JP, although his character should certainly know that. But for a quick shot of the infamous muddied Barbasol can in his office, you could completely forget who he is. He acts more like an eccentric Steve Jobs with only one foot in reality than the cutthroat scientist he should be. "We've got Dodgson here!"...yet "nobody cares." Nedry was right.If you've read up to this point (congratulations), you'll note I've barely mentioned the dinosaurs. Say what you will about the other movies, but at least they were all about the dinos. Many had distinct personalities that made them terrifying. One of Fallen Kingdom's mistakes was recrafting the sole surviving raptor (the villains of the first JP) as the hero, and raptors are no longer scary. Dominion goes further. Now the raptor (Blue) has reproduced (don't ask) and is a doting mother. There's no menace, and, further, Blue is sidelined for most of the film.Yes, there are dinosaurs, including other types of raptors. Dominion takes Fallen Kingdom's lame concept of laser-guided raptors and embraces it, resulting in a motorcycle/cargo plane chase through Malta that, while visually impressive (and welcome as the first action sequence 45 minutes in), belongs in a Bond or Bourne movie. (Dominion hops across several genres.)Where these never-before-seen dinosaurs came from is unknown. No more than 50 were released in Fallen Kingdom, and these new species were not among them. No explanation...moving on. Some new dinos in Dodgson's "animal preserve" (*cough* new park) seem interesting, although we don't know anything about them. To the film's credit, there is a tensely shot sequence involving Claire hiding in a lake from a spine-chilling carnivore. It's the closest Dominion comes to recreating the quiet fear of the original, and it's due to the movie deciding to slow down and take a welcome breath.Though why this lake is liquid when another lake in the same general area and time is frozen over enough to walk on shows a lack of continuity. It feels as though the creative team became entirely overwhelmed with the snowballing plot threads and characters that inconsistencies like this became commonplace. Trevorrow reportedly was pleased Covid delayed the film's release a year because it would allow them more time in post-production, yet with the uneven editing and overall breakneck pace, you wouldn't know it. They had extra time to edit together a cohesive, understandable plot and failed to do so.But Dominion's biggest sin is that it simply isn't scary. Aside from the noted lake sequence, there is no terror, no dread, no sense of dangerous awe. A new apex predator bigger than the T-Rex is supposed to frighten us. It doesn't. When the paths of the JP leads and JW leads finally merge while cornered by the big dinos, they act like they're in peril, but we don't buy it. We don't believe any of these stars will die (they don't), and we're not invested enough in them to care anyway. The characters lack agency, and it's boring. Dominion mostly swaps quiet scenes of terror of humans using their wits to face off against dinos (e.g., JP's T-Rex escape, raptors in the kitchen) for interchangeable dinos fighting each other in yawn-inducing brawls.During one of these, Dr. Grant notes aloud: "This isn't about us." How true, and how sad. Dominion fails to exert dominion over itself.

I'm going to make this short...Jurassic World: Dominion is like cleaning out your refrigerator and dumping a bunch of stuff in the trash. Only in this case, they decided to dump the "stuff" on the screen in this film. Jurassic World: Dominion has a lot of story arcs with no real connection or depth. People are popping in, popping back out, then popping in again, boring us with trite laughable dialogue and no real character development; you don't really care about any of these people. Just when you think there might be something to a scene with the familar charcaters, CUT TO another scene with no set-up. This film is like watching a 3:00 AM B-movie that is so bad, it does its job by putting you back to sleep. And let's talk about the dinosaurs, velociraptors and various man-eating prehistoric creatures...nah, it's not worth it because other than the penultimate scene where the biggest and baddest were going at each other, they were simply an after-thought. Go figure.Everyone connected to this film tried to do too much and it didn't work as far as the storytelling is concerned. As I said before, they emptied the refrigerator and threw in everything in this film and it left a bad taste in my mouth because there was just too much "stuff."

I don't know whether this is a fabled memory, but a few years ago I think I read an interview where director Colin Trevorrow said that the story of Dominion was always his ultimate go-to, that Jurassic World and Fallen Kingdom were the stepping stones to there (almost as if it was gathering the right build-up with characters, fan anticipation, budget, and technological advances). For every reason imaginable, I believed him. Where Fallen Kingdom ended, you had endless opportunity to explore the world with dinosaurs running amok and causing mayhem. Final shots of Fallen Kingdom included the T-Rex at a zoo, the Mosasaurus attacking surfers, a velociraptor overlooking a suburban California, and pterodactyls towering above a tourist-populated Las Vegas. It was all there; think The Lost World's San Diego epilogue but on a grander scale with more dinosaurs. Throw in the military, philosophical conversations regarding their eradication versus their survival, advance some more characters, and you have a bona fide fun summer blockbuster.This didn't happen.No matter what my actual opinion is of the film hereon out, I can't help but be letdown with disappointment that Trevorrow either deluded himself into believing this was the kind of conclusion that fans yearned for ala War for the Planet of the Apes (which has a much more compelling protagonist that makes it work despite its story misdirection) or J. A. Bayona pulled a Rian Johnson and put him in a corner with the concluding chapter that he had to rectify and had no actual written plan of his own. And it's not that there isn't a medium where this story doesn't work just fine. I can imagine the main plot elements being adapted from, say, a novelization or a comic series. Hell, there was even that Battle at Big Rock short that was done which could have told these elements on their own, or at the very least introduced them. Instead, they threw in extremely disjointed story bits for this final chapter that seemed to have no source of origin. They felt like they were the contrivance meant to unite our two character groups, and nothing more.Dominion starts off very okay. It shows that it can slow down, have a genuine heartbeat, provide pathos for the existence of our reptilian brethren, trot the globe to see how they have integrated (or not) with our species, and reintroduce characters new and old (with possible internal conflicts) to show how they would pave their globetrotting paths. They even fix some of the poorly written aspects of Fallen Kingdom such as maturing Franklin's character, giving better use to the laser-targeting attack system, and giving Maisie a more believable backstory. All of this is supported with fantastic animatronic work and much improved CGI blending with it. I thought the visuals were mostly a knockout and supported the onscreen setups.Not only that, but Sam Neill, Laura Dern, and Jeff Goldblum kindled a similar flame to their interactions in JP1 and you sat forward to watch those moments. I caught myself smiling quite a few times during those exchanges. Jeff Goldblum was especially used well as he was able to inject entertainment and comedy through his dialogue where the film otherwise was flat with on its attempts. They were not small cameo appearances and served crucial roles to the film. You buy where they are in their lives, and even though TLW and JP3 are retconned the actors clearly tapped into those experiences for their performances to accentuate their statuses.Speaking of buy-in, I would have given this film a long leash on a lot of things they could have done or did with this movie. We hit the point where we can embrace the ridiculous in several places. Want to make Blue become Owen's pet and attack guard? Go right on ahead. Want to modernize the action and give our protagonists more ability and skill that you might see in the Fast &amp; Furious franchise or with our human Marvel heroes? If the dinosaurs get their large share of the action as well, I'm on board (the Malta scene is a perfect example of this). Want to pay homage to the previous films as you conclude your franchise? That is what I expect. I also expect them to diversify this on a tonal level where need be as to not become too stale, and I think I was feeling that here. Hell, there is nearly a half-hour duration where not a single dinosaur is shown or brought up, and if it's in anticipation for what is to come while building character or story then I will let it play out.The problem really arose both when the movie decided to abandon the broad, peregrinating experience and confine its setting. Dominion is the saga's epic conclusion and did not need to put on this hat. This was a major rug pull from what was anticipated, and soured itself spending an excruciatingly long time on something that left little entertainment, tension, or dinosaurs. When they do show up, the moments become a little one-note. Our good guys have plot armor such as raptors that can run at vehicle speeds but can't catch up to running characters, or when they are cornered they just get roared at or ran/flown/swam past until they find their way out of the situation, or when they know they can stand around and trust that a carnivore won't eat them because reasons. Bryce Dallas Howard got the best/most suspenseful dino encounters at this stage of the film and they actually work extremely well, but for a near 150-minute movie these are few and far between, and for this franchise you really have to sit and ask yourself if there is a chance that she won't survive any of these instances.A lot of this could have been made better if our Rexy got some great moments, but even she was backdropped and upstaged too often to matter, or when she does come on screen it seems to be a rehashed occurrence from something of old. She looked and sounded good, though. I want to restate how good the dinosaurs actually looked here, and I want to commend the visual effects departments for what they were able to do in that department. If there was a niggle I'd have here, it would probably be in the weight of the raptor movement which felt too light and jittery. That probably only makes sense in my head, but the rest looked really good. If knowing that I would have to wait 21 years after 2001's Jurassic Park III to finally get the sequel with visuals that really soar, I would gladly take it. I just wish it was with a better film, or at least with a film that I would want to rewatch over and again. Instead, this left an aftertaste that makes me want to instead go and watch Top Gun: Maverick for a fourth time. Outside of demo material, I don't even know if I will be a completionist and get this on UHD a few months down the line. Normally one shouldn't fault a film for letting their own speculation become expectation, but in this particular instance I very much believe that you can. All signs and promotions hinted toward a different kind of movie and story, but despite the good parts it did have, this was too much of a misguided, ineffectual whimper.

Easily my least favorite movie in the Jurassic Park saga. Absolutely horrible on ever level and a fundamental misunderstanding at what makes this saga so interesting. Trevorrow had no clue what he was doing with this movie. He was told to make the final film in a six movie saga and said to himself "Hmm let's not focus on the dinosaurs in this FINAL FILM". How do you not understand what people want to see these movies for. You need to actually focus on the dinosaurs or you are not gonna keep peoples attention and I feel that is what happened here. Instead the film focuses on giant locusts? Why is this so interesting that you need to sideline the dinosaurs for it. I didn't want to see an espionage story about kidnapping, locusts, and clones. I just want to see what the world would be like if dinosaurs took over which we don't see either. The main issue that happened in the previous film that CHANGED THE STATUS QUO is barely focused on besides a few scenes. It's baffling why they would do this. Not even the original cast can save this. Jeff Goldblum and Sam Neill seem like they are having fun but the dialogue they are given is horrendous. The dialogue in general is bad but they got it the worst. The whole cast generally doesn't seem to be trying besides Neill and Goldblum. Everyone felt very low energy and if they didn't want to be there. The villain gave the worst performance in the film. They just let that guy spitball all these awkward lines and just didn't know when to say cut. The film feels relatively low stakes as well. It doesn't feel like a finale at all but more like a bad epilogue. Fallen Kingdom feels more like a finale than this and that movie is BAD. There isn't any build up to the final dinosaur battle as well. Apparently it was set up in the prologue that they released a year ago but they decided to cut it from the movie. They decide to cut the scene that shows the conflict between different species of dinosaur. Yeah great job guys. It doesn't help that this film is mindlessly boring as well and it doesn't deserve its 2 and a half hour runtime. This is a train wreck of a film that you shouldn't watch even if you like the original film. It's a waste of your money.

Jurassic World Dominion feels like it became a self-parody during the first act of the movie. Sure it's nice that they're referencing the past movies in kind, but the lapses in logic, the annoying deus-ex machinas at play, the apparent brainlessness of some of the characters and the dinosaurs becoming part of Earth's everyday socioeconomic hemisphere: it was a wasted opportunity and felt like a misleading tease from Fallen Kingdom.There was potential here: uniting two generations of Jurassic Park casts, uniting the dinosaurs in their fight for survival, and maybe even showing the fallout of such a situation where dinosaurs now actually co-exist alongside people.The Jurassic franchise has definitely exhausted all possibilities at this point in time: but I think we KNOW Universal's are least considering another sequel to this 'conclusion'.What next? Jurassic Stars? Where they take the dinosaurs literally to outer-space or something? At least that'd provide some more ironic entertainment and become a midnight movie phenomenon.

I loved the first Jurassic Park (1993) film and still think it's an amazingly enjoyable movie. Unfortunately, every entry after is never as good or even downright bad. Jurassic World Dominion is the final entry in the Jurassic World trilogy and the one that unites the cast of Jurassic Park and Jurassic World together. To see the return of the main trio from Jurassic Park was the biggest reason I was looking forward to this film. Does Jurassic World Dominion stick the landing or is it just a big pile of s#*%?One thing that the Jurassic World franchise has done better and better is the visuals. Jurassic World Dominion has no doubt the best visuals and cinematography of all the films so far. There are some pretty great shots of dinosaurs without a doubt. There are also some pretty fun action sequences. For example, in Malta where dinosaurs are chasing Chris Pratt and Bryce throughout the city. The part in Malta also explores the black market of Dinosaurs and that was pretty interesting. One pretty annoying issue with the Jurassic World franchise is the lack of animatronics but Dominion uses a lot of animatronics. I appreciated it as it made the Dinosaurs feel a bit more real when they were being interacted with.My biggest reason for watching was the OG cast and it was great seeing all of them together again. Laura Dern and Sam Neill are great together as Ellie Satler and Alan Grant respectively. Both of them don't phone it in and it feels like the same characters we last saw 21 years ago. My favourite is Jeff Goldblum as Ian Malcolm and he just steals every scene he is in. Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard also return and they are fine. The movie introduces some new characters and one of them is Kayla played by DeWanda Wise. DeWanda is great and a real standout in the film thanks to her charismatic performance. Kayla ends up being a fun character to watch thanks to her coolness and natural reaction to all the craziness happening.Unfortunately, the rest of the movie is very difficult to like. My biggest annoyance is the plot. There are two plot lines, one with Chris Pratt involving a kidnapping of Maisie (the clone daughter from the previous film) and another with the OG cast which just features them snooping around a big corporation. One of the plotlines is more exciting and interesting while also resulting in thrilling dinosaur action. The OG cast plotline is just so boring, goofy and just dumb. It's a shame that the OG cast was done dirty like that. The movie feels like two different movies shoved into one leading to two different stories with different tones. The main story also features this plot device concerning locusts and it's just really stupid.The movie also features a sort of new human villain in Dodgson played by Campbell Scott. I say sort of new because he is technically playing the same character that was briefly in the first Jurassic Park film albeit it's a different actor now. He is just a very underwhelming villain. He is just not that interesting or threatening. They also have a new dinosaur villain in the Giganotosaurus and it also sucks. It barely has any screen time and is not even as scary as any of the previous dinosaur villains. There is also another new character introduced called Ramsay played by Mamoudou Athie who I think does a good job in the role. What makes his character is his supposed relationship with Dodgson which is mentioned a couple of times. However, it is barely explored yet for some reason is put into the film like it is an emotional or important element and it was just baffling.Maisie returns from the previous film and has become incredibly unlikeable. I'm not a big fan of bratty kid characters, especially ones that cause the deaths of dozens of innocent people. Her character is written poorly and I do think the actress gives a pretty weak performance which doesn't help. The movie is also way too long with its runtime being 146 minutes. A majority of the runtime is just boring human stuff with maybe 15-20 minutes of some dinosaur stuff. The original Jurassic Park cast and the new Jurassic World cast don't even meet until the final act. Once they meet, it feels very anti-climatic and unnatural, it just sort of happens. I'm gutted that the movie wastes an interesting idea in exploring the consequences of dinosaurs being released into the world and how the world deals with it. Instead, this idea is just brushed over within the first 5 minutes. The film doesn't do anything original and just does dinosaurs on an island again! The movie doesn't even spend time dealing with the message that the film starts with which is can humans and dinosaurs coexist? The film just ends with this magically being answered and resolved with no explanation how?Overall, what a massive disappointment. While I didn't particularly enjoy Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom (2018), the movie ends on a fascinating note that could've made for an amazing 3rd film. Regrettably, Jurassic World Dominion ends up being more interested in being a cheap, cheesy, B movie action thrill and even then it doesn't do that great either. I'm devastated that the so-called Avengers of the Jurassic franchise is just a very mediocre and underwhelming dinosaur movie. I ended up feeling like it was time for this franchise to go extinct. As Ian once said, "that's one big pile of s#*%".

Colin Trevorrow has managed to make himself the Ryan Johnson of the Jurassic Park franchise with this film and the vanity with which he promoted and defended it. Jurassic World: Dominion is a soulless film, without a shred of understanding of the magic of the original. This made-for-its-own-good movie has no originality on its own terms, no respect for the fans of this once-grand dinosaur movie series, and not an ounce of artistic merit to the film genre. On top of that, this film is also dumb from start to finish and full of holes in the story. It's a good thing Trevorrow is also responsible for the screenplay and apparently spent years looking forward to this finale, because according to his own statements, he knew from the start to which end he wanted to lead the Jurassic World trilogy.The film begins by leaving out its own story plots from the last two films. For example, how the dinosaurs were able to spread across the planet is left out, or it is assumed that you accept that this is explained via the illegal and legalized trade in the animals. The dinosaur scenes at the beginning are quite nice, but ultimately just a two-minute montage of big dinosaur scenes. The animal rescue comes across as a naive idea in the context of the film and additionally as a silly attempt at a cross-reference to the actually problematic treatment of animals in our society. The character development of Claire Dearing (Bryce Dallas Howard) is just thrown at you, Owen Grady (Chris Pratt), on the other hand, is so on the mark in his already shallow and cliché-laden development that as a viewer you can definitely handle the fact that he is now foolishly riding horses, severing individual dinosaurs from their herd for "rescue". Secondary characters are introduced, only to be used as vehicles for the unfolding silly story without any depth of their own. The story surrounding the characters in the Jurassic World series quickly devolves into a globe-trotting, bad James Bond knock-off with a focus on the use of firearms, car chases and silly, superficial short cons. It goes to some Arabian countries, to a stupidly hidden black market for dinosaur goods, to a reservation of the company of "Dogson!". We've got Dodgson here" - Dodgson (Campbell Scott), who for reasons not told somehow managed to become one of the biggest tech moguls in the world. Just as somehow, by the way, he has also managed to recover the nostalgic cream can of Dennis Nedry's dinosaur DNA theft and keep it on his shelf. Their story then just jumps from action scene to action scene, where the "heroes" of the story, staged in a very modern way, survive every adversity. Apart from gunshots and dinosaur attacks, they survive a plane crash, numerous accidents and explosions unharmed. This plot, which undercuts any suspense, also leads to no fear or adrenaline buildup at all around the characters, which should actually serve to help viewers identify with them. Trevorrow makes himself the king of despondency here and destroys the legacy of the original film and its two original and respectful sequels.By the way, the motivation for the cloned girl Maisie Lockwood (Isabella Sermon) is simply thrown overboard. Yes, that's how this trilogy was planned by the would-be visionary Trevorrow. Instead of the comprehensible cloning of the lost daughter, it is now the daughter herself who clones herself. The motivation, of course, is to save the world from disease and natural disasters. Oh, no, the motivation was the desire to save one's own new self from a deadly disease from which one suffers. Or was it? Didn't Trevorrow write a scene in which it's made clear that Lockwood didn't know about her disease when she cloned herself? Well, at least Trevorrow is so self-convinced that he doesn't care about consistency in the plot even in the context of just one film. The director and filmmaker never seems to have read an ethics book either, because the cloning action is consensually presented as a moral heroic act. Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) would have to perceive this as a slap in the face, but what do the philosophical underpinnings of the original matter if a film is just poured on with cool sayings and action scenes without paying attention to the plot or the development of individual highlights in the film.The plot around the characters of the original resembles chicanery for the fans of the franchise. The dream team of Alan Grant (Sam Neil), Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern) and Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum), which worked so well, is suddenly a group consisting only of references to the grandiose start of the series, which becomes more insufferable, shallow and uninteresting by the minute. Their plot around the locust plague, which at least at the beginning seems like an interesting idea before it too is told into the barrel, is at least a tad better than the action movie scenes around Pratt and Howard. But again, it's overflowing with plot holes, dumb lines, and a dynamic between Grant and Sattler so unpleasant it could make you sick. Laura Dern, by the way, plays her role so badly that she makes Ellie Sattler the most unpleasant character in the film, but since her Star Wars appearance, she's been practiced at helping destroy classic franchises.BD Wong's character development, by the way, is among the dumbest in film history. From an over-motivated and morally disinterested character in Jurassic Park, to the self-convinced and morally still subterranean leader in Jurassic World, to the morally now completely disintegrated dinosaur trader from Fallen Kingdom, we now witness here a Henry Wu who at the beginning of the film is still responsible for a biblical-capitalist plague of locusts, but at the end of the film is sneaking through a cornfield like a reformed science hippie, enjoying the redemptive feeling of moral poise. Incredibly stupid.Unbelievably stupid is much else in this film as well. The overpopulation of different dinosaurs that you get to see for a few seconds attests to a lack of understanding of the magic of the original and a lack of appreciation for the genius of how the dino scenes were handled there. The sprinkling of modern wokeness is still within limits, but where it does appear it is, as you might expect, just plain silly. The waste of potential from the old films is obvious here. The Dilophosaurs are wasted, the Carnosaurs are so scary that a couple of betting-addicted dino-fight viewers just keep watching a dino-human fight while a few feet behind them the Carnosaurs wreak havoc. The Dimetrodon, which by the way are not dinosaurs, are barely shown, just as no dinosaur can be viewed even once with enough time and calm, instead they become animal horror creatures with nothing on them but brutal aggressiveness. In the end, there is yet another stupid dinosaur fight that seems like an even dumber copy of the stupid finale of the otherwise watchable first part of the Jurassic World trilogy. The T-Rex pretending to be dead is perhaps the dumbest dino scene in the entire franchise. Let's not forget that Dearing and Grady's love for their adopted daughter is so strong that they simply make the girl stand very, very close to a velociraptor at the end of the film, because Grady is, after all, friends with this primeval predator. In order to shoot such nonsense, one must have a completely narcissistic alienation from reality....
One could go on for a long time listing the numerous plotholes, stupidities and the impudent lack of understanding of what made the original so fantastic, but that would probably take readers of this review just as long as this bloated action nonsense has running time. But one thing needs to be mentioned: The recap of the plot and the outcome for the planet presented at the end of the film is over-politicized, naive, unscientific garbage that you can either laugh your head off at in cynical fashion or cry yourself to sleep in lonely despair over humanity. Dinosaurs coexisting in harmony with the rest of nature, triceratops performing their savannah march with elephants, geese flying fearlessly with pterodactyls, blue whales swimming in peace alongside a mosasaur, and herds of wild horses, mingling with other racing dinosaur herds are certainly realistic and the ultimate goal that a human race should have in the context of a specially created species extinction by genetically manipulating the evolutionary rhythm of Earth's history.As a conclusion, it remains to mention once again that Trevorrow could impressively prove his complete lack of cinematic understanding with this film and that Star Wars: The Last Jedi now has to share the Olympus of destroyed franchises with Jurassic World: Dominion. Nothing short of a disgrace to cinema history. Tragic.

It's just amazing that no dinosaur hasn't bitten it off yet. In what promises to be the conclusion to the series, all the main cast members of the previous shows are here. "Alan Grant....... Ellie Sattler", I actually liked the new characters. DaWanda Wise and Mamoudou Athie better than the old ones - they are the only ones that come out of this unscathed. The special effects are, as expected, first class although really? A Gigilomopoloposaurus??? - they just keep getting bigger (the dinosaurs AND the names). Not sure that it's worth the Hollywood Blvd/Times Sq ticket prices ($20+) , but it's an okay way to spend a summer afternoon. I think tho, I'd wait til next weekend when the crowds will be 65% less.

Why?They had one easy job. One. Job. Dinosaurs in the human world. Those T. Rex scenes from The Lost World? Yeah, do that, but with a bunch of different dinosaurs in different parts of the world. That's it. The premise doesn't make much sense and the human-only parts of the story might as well be bad, but hey, at least we would have seen dinos doing their cool dino stuff in our world. You know, as it was advertised?Instead, they wasted the budget that COULD have been spent on the CGI/writing necessary for this on actors from past JP movies and ads that looked more fun than the movie itself. As a result, we got this utter disappointment that is basically a generic sci-fi action movie with some dinosaurs here and there.I just wish the people who approved all of this would realize that there is profit to be made for their greedy corporate hands by making fun movies that aren't 2 hours of false advertising and failed nostalgia bait. Alas, I will most likely get even more disappointed in the years to come.I must give it 1 star, not because I want to, but because I feel it is my obligation as a JP fan since I was a small child.

I absolutely hated this film... legacy characters used as bait for box office numbers, a horrible plot that makes the incredibly long runtime absolutely insufferable. The actors aren't at fault, the visuals are good (as you might expect from a movie this expensive), but the script is atrocious, and "the epic conclusion" is not very much a conclusion, the main issue is not solved, and everything that was wrong in the previous films is just elevated in this film, absolutely terrible film, don't watch it.

This is my least favorite of all the Jurassic movies. The original was excellent and fun. This was an excuse to have a reunion. The movie can't stand on its own. I watched it with someone who had never seen any of the previous Jurassic movies. He didn't get it. I thought we were passed films that allowed the stars to keep their makeup on after swimming through algea covered ponds. Not even camp enough to be fun.

I will say this for Colin Trevorrow: unlike other Hollywood writers/directors, who seem to be actively spiteful towards the classic sagas they are writing sequels to, when Trevorrow says he is a fan of Jurassic Park, I believe him.That's why Jurassic World Dominion feels, for good and for ill, like the world's most expensive fan film, cramming in nearly every dinosaur known to man and every character, meme and in-joke from the previous five movies (button up your shirt, Malcom! Get your hat, Grant! Oh look, Nedry's old Barbasol can!).I'm betting that if the great Pete Postlethwaite had not passed away we would have gotten Roland Tembo rappelling from a helicopter to shoot an Oviraptor in the face.The movie is at least twenty minutes too long - Hollywood seems incapable to make a non-bloated blockbuster today, even Bond movies have the running time of The Thin Red Line - and it doesn't have a shred of the wit and intelligence of my beloved first Jurassic Park, but I did like a few set-pieces (the Therizinosaurus, the frozen lake...) and it's always nice to see the awesome Sam Neill back, so I guess the fan bait worked to an extent.6/10.

The new Jurassic World movie has got to be one of the worst big budget hollywood film I have seen in quite a while. The old returning actors are not enough to save the clunky dialogue or the absolutely pointless story here. As a conclusion to this trilogy, it fails in a majority of areas. Worst of all, in addition to being sloppily put together, is it's beyond derivitive. I honestly feel like I've seen the majority of these story tropes used in a vast catalog of other, much better films. Also, it has one of the worst villians I've seen put to screen. His acting and the dialogue for his character was about the equivilant of a 3 year old throwing a tantrum. Beyond annoying and even more unrealistic. The special FX weren't even anything awesome, just more of the same. However, I do have to give it up to the team that did the creature designs for the practical FX, those were more impressive. I would recommend waiting for streaming, it wasn't even worth seeing on the IMAX as the majority of scenes were not worthy of the scale. 1/2 a dino out of 5.

Life once found a way. Now, I hope it loses itself.Jurassic World Dominion has its positives, namely the fantastic Legacy character's wonderful return and, well, that's it. I enjoyed their presence, especially Laura Dern and Jeff Goldblum - the latter who had the best lines, as always. The rest...yeah, I sincerely hope this is the last Jurassic Anything.All throughout this movie, the word "Dumb" just kept popping up in my head. Dumb script. Dumb dialogue. Dumb luck with all the hilariously impossible coincidences. Too many Dumb references to this series and other Steven Spielberg classics. And the two Dumbest characters in the franchise are back: Clone Girl Maisie who hates all mankind for her decision in the last entry and that screaming boy, Franklin, though, THANK GOD, he doesn't scream in this one like all the scenes he ruined in the last one.With a huge missed opportunity to expand on the actual title of Jurassic World, this hopefully last chapter just has society dealing with dinos killing people and the economy while debating if they should be extinguished. But, never mind that, this series has always been around greed and the ineptest baddie of the franchise with the most hilariously bad security detail is up to no good and only our 1,500 heroes in this movie can stop him!While the second half is monstrously better than the first half, I still couldn't wait for this movie to be over. Sure, it's better than the two worst sequels: III and Fallen Kingdom, but not by much. Like the Terminator, this franchise should've stopped at #2 in The Lost World.The movie's absolutely boring, even with multiple action scenes and there are literally no stakes. In fact, I was always hoping throughout the first two acts, they'd have the balls to kill off any of the characters. As much as I would love to see the Legacy characters make it - forgetting about the new Jurassic World characters, never liked them much - at least the movie would've taken chances.I'm done with this series. Like Transformers 4 and Pirates of the Caribbean 4, even if they make another one (like they did with those franchises,) I won't be watching another one. This was just crap.***Final Thoughts: Easy listing of the Series. Hint: Only watch the 1st three listed below.1. Jurassic Park2. The Lost World: Jurassic Park3. Jurassic World97. Jurassic World Dominion98. Jurassic Park III99. Jurassic World Fallen Kingdom.

Wow, foiled again, a movie from my youth gets a long awaited follow up, it has a great cast, with some familiar faces, a big budget, so there's action galore, and some wonderful music, but a plot..... a plot that could have been written by a random stranger walking past the studio.How on Earth is it possible for such a film to feel so vacuous, so empty, this film made me feel nothing, other than boredom. £40 that could have been used on so many other things.It's not ok these days to simply try and dazzle us with some awesome visuals, there needs to be some sort of plot, but there just isn't one, in simplistic terms it asks if man can live with dinosaurs, but of course you know what's going to happen. Some of the visuals are great, epic, some scenes though....did they run out of time?Chris Pratt, didn't do it for me, the old cast tried, but it felt hollow.Like the dinosaurs themselves, this franchise should have been left in the past. 3/10.

Truly a shameful film made in a hurry and without a plot that is linear or otherwise makes sense. Since Jurassic World in 2015 the Jurassic saga has gone to die, with dinosaurs that were better made in 1993 and with characters that try to retrace the steps of the main protagonists of Jurassic Park but fail to even be iconic for the film itself. Somebody has to stop them, they are ruining a saga that was never supposed to be revived again, it was over in 2001 and I still ask myself now, "but was it really needed?" I sincerely hope that this is the last chapter, although I'm afraid not, because really how can you put locusts as the villain of the movie... ARE WE KIDDING? I would have expected anything, but locusts don't. Then there are some characters in particular Henry Wu who in the previous 2 chapters was the villain who created monsters and here instead he wants to save everyone but for no good reason, they don't explain why Wu became good from one moment to the next and this angers people no end. Let's not talk about how they evolved Maisie Lockwood's character because I really found her ridiculous. One of the worst movies of this year, someone needs to stop this CRAZY.

This CGI action fest is a flaccid abhorrent mess. It is aimless, pointless, chaotic, meaningless, frivolous, devoid of meaning, cheap, derivative, pandering, confused and very irritating.The only thing pure about this vile abomination targetting the lowest of the lowest denominators is that it shows pure Hollywood greed and their lack of respect for culture.People responsible for this miscarriage of a movie should be ashamed of themselves and never be allowed to work in the arts again in any capacity. This literally is the worst...

Rare seeing Brad Pitt in a movie like this but from what I understand the director is a good friend of his. It's an action movie the reads like Smoking Aces. An ensemble cast with a few different stories in it, of which, interestingly enough Brad Pitt's story as a man named Ladybug could be considered just as important as the others despite being the star.Unlike Smoking Aces, the Bullet Train in itself is a character and a very expensive one that makes it a blockbuster. On top of that the very cool Celebrity Cameos that prove this director makes friends with everyone he works with in Hollywood.The Japanese back drop was cool not just because I'm an anime fan but because it made the film and the bullet train visual amazing to look at, but Hollywood needs more Japanese actors who can speak English. Hiroyuki Sanada is become the Danny Trejo of the Far East.Its action packed and its humorous everything I want when watching a movie in theatres.

This is a highly entertaining action-comedy that oozes style. It's extremely fun and a bit on the outrageous side, not meant to be taken too seriously. It's filled with funny and memorable moments. The action is awesome, well-shot and clear, which is no surprise coming from the guy who directed John Wick, Atomic Blonde and Deadpool 2.There are a ton of characters and I like them all. The cast does such a great job, especially Brian Tyree Henry and Aaron Taylor-Johnson. I remember first seeing Brian Tyree Henry in Atlanta and really enjoying that role. Since then, he has taken on vastly different roles and killed all of them. And I already thought Aaron Taylor-Johnson is a great actor, but the way he completely transforms into his character is remarkable. To the point where you don't see Aaron Taylor-Johnson. Literally. I didn't realize it was him until the credits rolled.If I had to come up with negatives, I would say it's a bit hectic at times, but not enough to take me out of it. And the story borders on being convoluted, but I was able to follow it all so I'll call it intricate instead.In the end I had a great time with this movie and would definitely watch it again, although I'll be turning on subtitles since some dialogue was hard to understand in a Snatch kind of way.EDIT: On second viewing, my negatives disappeared. And a couple things that stood out even more: The music is beastly and Brad Pitt's facial expressions in the reaction shots are priceless.

Was excited heading into this because it's the first movie I watched on early release. Tried to avoid spoilers so assumed it was going to be Japanese/Korean just because I kept thinking of Train to Busan when I heard the title.Anyway, it was pretty decent, the actors performances are great all around, it wasn't just Brad Pitt doing most of the heavy lifting. A lot of star cameo's; standout for me was Channing Tatum, felt tit-for-tat after Brad's cameo in The lost City. I was also glad to hear Kimiko from the boys finally speak lol. The comic scenes and action were great, I liked how they were mostly in short bursts and quick. Directed by the same person who did Deadpool, John wick, Hobbs &amp; Shaw... liked that it had the same level of action but as frivolous as Hobbs &amp; Shaw. I was a bit dubious about Joey King taking a lead role because I often think of her as someone in cheesy Netflix teen romcoms but she did alright.I was curious as to see what interesting plot it'd have if everything takes place on one train ride, but Snowpiercer and Busanhaeng did it, why not this. They tried to make a big deal out of "fate" but really the movie is just a rather star-studded cast, most don't get long but had fun with the little time they have. So if you're to enjoy it, watch it to have fun, not to get meaning from it.I did feel like some scenes were a tad bit too long especially in the first half, and it wasn't exactly predictable but it did lack some suspense. You know everyone on the train's somehow connected so the stories will merge in the end but you didn't know how it'd get there, yet still no suspense. I don't think it's a mind-blowing film but it did what it was trying to do. Also felt like a fun spaghetti western on a Japanese train. They tried to give the characters some depth but it wasn't much, the plot's sometimes weak and that's irrelevant because it's not what the movie is for. Not something to make sense of, it's just one of those nonsensical fun action films that appeal to the part of your brain that likes seeing things blow up or car chases to get your heart pumped. Also stay around for the post credits right after.

Even though it goes off the rails with an overblown CG finale Bullet Train is still a total blast from beginning to end thanks to the endless visual style, surprising twists and plenty of gleefully violent and energetically shot/choreographed action set pieces.Brad Pitt gives a terrific lead performance, completely unafraid to make fun of himself whilst still being a capable action star. The standouts of the film with their perfect chemistry and great humour is Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Brian Tyree Henry.Hiroyuki Sanada and Andrew Koji are definitely the heart of the film with soulful performances and the most emotional sub-plot that skillfully balance out all the humour and irreverence.David Leitch's direction is amazing, the film just oozes style with gorgeous lighting, vibrant colours and inventive camera work. The soundtrack is excellent, all the song choices work and never feel like they're trying too hard.

If you're fed up of dreary Oscar contenders making points and taking an age to get to them, this is for you. Entertaining, fast paced, action romp with good set pieces and plenty of fun moments.And to the critics: no, there is no "character development" and yes, the "plot" is not that believable. It's light entertainment not Samuel Beckett.

SCORE: 10/10That was one of the craziest things I have ever seen and it all makes sense now. I always tell people that Deadpool 2 is the movie I point at to describe what I love in a movie. The same guy who directed Deadpool 2 directed this, David Leitch, and he is an absolute genius. This movie was a never ending plot twist masterpiece combined with top tier comedy, fun, action, and even some unexpected cameos. After seeing the trailer, I knew this was going to be a fun movie, but I didn't imagine I would enjoy it as much as I did.The success of this movie can be directly attributed to both a great story and amazing acting all around. The entire cast did such a great job that I really can't single out one person for carrying this movie. Just like in Deadpool 2, there were multiple points at which the story could've ended and I would've been satisfied, but it just kept getting better and better and better. I still feel some type of way about Tangerine dying after Lemon and The Elder's son came back to life. Other than that, this movie was perfect.The way that this story was told was so creative and impressive, especially since they were able to tell it for pretty much the entire movie being in one location. The title cards when introducing characters was awesome and it found a way to be funny without being silly. A silly movie sometimes takes away from the rest of the story, but a majority of the humor was well timed, well executed, and consistent. The plot twists were insane and I couldn't keep my eyes off the screen while waiting to see what would happen next. And yes, Ryan Reynolds and Channing Tatum sure did contribute to this perfect score.

This movie grabs you from the start and doesn't let go. Its an entertaining whirlwind of goofy character after goofy character, and awesome fight after awesome fight. Brad Pitt nails his leading role and everyone else does great.The visuals of the film are fantastic- soaked in a beautiful neon glow. While soundtrack is fine but not too memorable outside of the film.Overall, this is a great summer watch.

I'll admit i've skewed my rating a bit, i've ranked it so highly rated based on the fact I knew what movie I was buying a ticket for. I'm not rating it highly because it's a modern classic, i'm doing it based on wanting to see a funny and entertaining action movie and in that respect it delivers pretty much everything I went to the cinema for.The premise of the film is basic, the cast is solid, the characters are excellent including mini side characters. The humour has a few misses but generally it is a pretty funny movie throughout, they also pay off everything that is set up along the way which makes it a satisfying watch. Also if you are yet to see it, stay through the credits as it does tie up one or two of those loose ends.The slight downside for me, were that the run time does sag a little toward the end but it is over 2 hours long and otherwise moved along at a steady rate.

I can't remember the last time I saw a film as full on as 'Bullet Train'. It is two hours of relentless action. It's actually a little exhausting to watch (it didn't help that the theatre I saw it in was set to about 30 degrees Celsius - but that's a different matter) - in a good way though.This is a very stylishly made film. It looks terrific. The acting is great and all the characters are very polished and cool as you would expect in a film about assassins. The train itself is an interesting setting too. It's technically a single-setting film but it never feels like it. The film moves so fast you feel like you are darting from country to country.I would say the one let down of the film was how little of the humour landed. Time and again there was an obvious attempt at a joke and I just didn't find even a smile coming to my face. There are some laughs along the way, but the hit to miss ratio is way off.It's a lot of fun this movie though regardless. There are endless cameos and twists and unexpected moments. The film certainly keeps you on your toes. 7/10.

I was not surprised this movie was as good as it was with the strong cast and budget. The humor and story telling were too tier.The action was easy to follow and there were enough twists and turns that it didn't feel like 2 hours.

I make a point of not watching trailers prior to watching a new film as experience tells me that rather than get me excited to watch a movie, they essentially give me an overly exposed look at a film with key plot points being shown. With this in mind, it was almost impossible to not see parts of trailers for Bullet Train, whether that was on TV or YouTube advertising etc. The marketing campaign for this film is mental, I have seen it everywhere.The trailer makes the movie look like a massive bloated action piece - Think Nonstop meets Train to Busan. However, having watched a couple of YouTube film reviews, I was pleasantly surprised to see it described as not just a brainless action movie, but more of a dialogue-based film with clever writing and fast paced back and forth. One reviewer compared it to Guy Ritchie's Snatch and the classic Pulp Fiction - Two of my favourite and most watched movies. That was enough for me, I was going to give it a try and I booked a couple of tickets for opening day, something that I don't do very often.Let's start with the Dialogue. If anything, it just tries too hard, far too hard. Most of the jokes didn't land for me and the delivery of the fast-paced dialogue quite often would not hit the mark. I can't quite but my finger on why that is. Is it simply poor writing? Or is it down to the delivery? Or is it simply that a number of my favourite movies are heavy, witty dialogue-based movies and my expectations were so high based on several reviews, that I just felt disappointed by this? Either way, it didn't really work for me.As you can imagine, almost all the action scenes involved in this movie were delivered on a train, meaning that the fight scenes needed to be compact and tight. This was delivered better than I expected to be fair and plenty of the action scenes were enjoyable, if not incredibly farfetched.The characters were relatively varied but were quite generic and cliché. Brad Pitt is essentially the lead actor and probably the best on show. Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Brian Tyree Henry (Tangerine and Lemon) were the characters which I was most excited to see, they played the east end cockney gangster/hitmen type characters. Unfortunately, they came across as just trying far too hard and the chemistry between them just wasn't as good as I imagine the director and producers thought it would be. The Thomas the Tank Engine metaphor also got repetitive after the 25th time it was mentioned. The rest of the cast are hit and miss, nothing majorly impressive and nothing majorly terrible. There are some strange cameos, and when I say cameos, I mean cameos. They literally get seconds of screen time.Overall, Bullet Train was entertaining enough as a popcorn flick and was an inoffensive way of turning my brain off for two hours and relaxing. I do feel that it's a slightly wasted opportunity though as I can see what the director was trying to do, but it just felt flat and missed the mark on quite a few occasions. Style over substance is the best way I would describe it.6/10.

A highly compelling action thriller, Brad Pitt stars as assassin Ladybug on the lookout for a stashed briefcase whilst in the hot trail of 5 other assassins on a rapidly moving train. A solidly entertaining thriller film, with it's humorous dialogue and quirky characters smoothly riding alongside it's fast paced fighting sequences. A well anticipated movie which has to be one of my favourites of 2022.

A sensational little fast moving cigar tube of laughs. Great characters, fun script and terrific action. Oh and twisty twisted plot.Pitt gets to play out his fantastic cameo from the pathetic Lost City. This movie gets the Bullock/Tatum/Pitt balance right and hence is a roaring success.

This movie is a ton of fun and out of control in a good way. Not usually a fan of Brad Pitt, but I think he does a fantastic job in this role. He's very convincing as a man that's just cursed with bad luck and has some fantastic one liners and questions throughout.It's not a movie that's meant to be taken seriously, but it does still offer a complex intricate story in a way. Amidst all of the dramatic and ridiculous fight scenes you're still tasked with trying to figure out who's pulling all of the strings and wondering how it's all going to play out.At times some of the scenes may drag out a little bit, but it's probably for the best so that it gives you a bit of time to process everything going on as well as recover from all of the the gruesome deaths that are frequently taking place.Definitely a solid summer comedic action movie as the summer season begins to "die down" (pun intended).

Bullet Train is definitely one of the most thrilling movies that I have seen this year so far. Brad Pitt, Joey King, Bad Bunny and Aaron Taylor-Johnson absolutely kill it in this movie. From start to end you will be on the edge of your seat. It's also very funnyIf I had any negatives with the film it would be the language just way too much. Other then that fantastic flawless movie.

It's clear a film is less than successful when an added scene pops up one or two minutes into the credits, and, rather than pausing to watch, the audience quickly glances up then resumes their escape from the auditorium as quickly as possible.This film felt like it ran for days on end. It reminded me of a dinner we had in a tourist restaurant in Morocco where the courses kept coming and coming until we began to despair. And yet on it went...just look like this movie.There was clearly a fair amount of technical talent that went into this turkey, but creative inspiration was noticeably absent. Instead of anything original, the viewer is subjected to an endless stream of sub-Tarantino and sub-Guy Ritchie guff that someone apparently thought was clever. Even cameos from Channing Tatum and a painfully face-lifted Sandra Bullock add zero to the experience.In sum, this expensive fiasco is like an evening gown that incorporates $10,000 worth of material in a design by a JC Penney junior assistant: gaudy, vulgar and a colossal misfire.

Greetings again from the darkness. If you are one that still needs proof that movie stars matter, this latest from director David Leitch (a former stuntman who also directed ATOMIC BLONDE, 2017) and screenwriter Zak Olkewicz (adapted from Kotaro Isaka's 2010 novel, "Maria Beetle") may be submitted as evidence. Replace Brad Pitt with almost any other actor, and this one becomes borderline unwatchable. However, with the Oscar winner, there is sufficient charm, humor, and entertainment to keep us around for the more than two hour run time.Mr. Pitt stars as Ladybug, a floppy bucket hat wearing last minute fill-in for an assassin who called in sick. His handler (voiced by Oscar winner Sandra Bullock) walks him through what is supposed to be a simple snatch and grab job involving a briefcase. Of course, it turns out to be anything but simple as the train is filled with what seems to be an endless stream of contract killers intent on securing the same briefcase. Among those are Tangerine (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) and Lemon (Brian Tyree Henry). Mr. Taylor-Johnson continues his tradition of over-acting and lacking the charm he believes he has, while Mr. Henry's obsession with Thomas the Tank Engine at least gives his character a reason for us to be annoyed. The two are referred to as British brothers or even 'twins', which gives you some idea of what the film wants you to buy as humor.A slew of other characters include Joey King as Prince, the "Shibumi" reading type who pushes a kid off a roof, and then uses her skill of crying-on-demand to escape most danger; Andrew Koji as Kimura, that kid's distraught father; Hiroyuki Sanada as Kimura's father; Zazie Beetz as The Hornet; rapper Bad Bunny as Wolf; Logan Lerman as the son of a Russian gangster, and Lerman spends much of the movie auditioning for the title character in "Weekend at Bernie's"; and Michael Shannon as said Russian gangster, White Death. Beyond all of these highly recognizable folks, we also get two very high-profile cameos, both used for comic effect.In between the one-minute stops on the trip from Tokyo to Kyoto, there is an abundance of fighting - comical, rapidly-paced, and violent - using such available props as the features on a smart toilet, knives, guns, swords, poison, bombs, and a venomous (incorrectly labeled as poisonous in the movie) Boomslang snake. Since most of the action takes place on the train, we get action in passenger cars, the galley, the lounge, the control booth, and even on top of the speeding train.It's Pitt's character who keeps us interested, and the movie drags when he is off screen. Ladybug is a skilled improvisational fighter, although his recent personal growth through therapy has him eschewing guns, dwelling on his inherent bad luck, and reciting affirmations and wisdoms, when he can remember them. Mostly, by golly, he just wants to be a nicer person (quite a short trip for a contract killer). This chaos and spontaneous convention of bad players were all part of White Death's plan, which is revealed late in the film.It appears director Leitch (a former renowned stuntman) worked diligently to create a new form of zany by blending Guy Ritchie's best work with Tarantino's "Kill Bill" films, and then adding a dash of 'who-done-what-to-whom?" Instead, with the near slapstick action and goofy dialogue, it plays more like a modern day CANNONBALL RUN, which was also directed by a former stuntman (the legendary Hal Needham). As a bonus, we also get the Japanese version of "Stayin' Alive", replete with Brad Pitt strutting through Tokyo in tennis shoes.Opens in theaters on August 5, 2022.

When Bullet Train is not trying to be a Tarantino rip-off or trying to cram eight separate movies into one, it can be an enjoyable ride. However, this is not the case most of the movie, getting derailed by the third act due to a mess of a story.

I just got home from seeing this and I'm still pumped up from how much fun this movie is. The acting was brilliant in this, loved all the characters everyone does a great job.The fight scenes are really well done, I love these hectic movies where everything links up and all means something without it losing its charm and Bullet Train does it perfectly. My favourite fight would have to be in the quiet car, funny and creative! I'm glad this movie was as bloody and gorey as it was too with some great kills. This movie just had me smiling the whole time, the bright neons and colours make it full of beautiful visuals too.I don't like seeing a 136 minute runtime but far out I didn't notice it at all, hooked from start to finish and will be going to watch again.Love this movie one of my favourites of the year easily and highly recommend going to see this one asap.Also that water bottle POV at the end was just so satisfying to watch, love it.Long live Thomas the tank.

The first trailer for this film is an examination of what makes a good film advertisement: it's funny, exciting and doesn't reveal too much. In short, it gets you hooked.The plot is complex, but not convoluted. No, it is positively intelligible. I loved the way it was slowly resolved. The premise itself, while not original, makes for some impressive and masterfully directed action scenes.Visually, I think the film has some impressive shots to offer. Particularly those that illustrate the plot of the Japanese players. The explicit but intelligent storytelling that emanates from the visuals is also remarkable.I loved the musical choices in this film, as they perfectly underscore certain scenes.The humour is not always hit and miss but it is very funny.There are only two elements of this film that I feel should be addressed. Firstly, the excessively gory violence at times. Secondly and finally, from a logical point of view, the fact that the events and fights that take place on the train are barely noticed by the other passengers.In summary, this enjoyable and energetic film offers a well-constructed plot with neat visuals, songs and masterful action.It's more then a bland action-in-a-train film.

Bullet Train (2022)If Brad Pitt wasn't in this film, I would have never even bothered with it despite being familiar with the entire cast because I've had my share of disappointing action. The first 25 minutes didn't do the movie any favors as it looked like a cheap parody of Pulp Fiction with pretentious dialogue and excessive self indulgence. I began to contemplate if I was going to end up watching Machete 3 based on the initial action, but then the plot began to get interesting, combat dialed up and the train took off.Bullet Train revolves around a bunch of assassins running after a highly prized briefcase that belongs to a crime boss named White Death. Additionally, every single killer on board has their own unique objective which ends up being derailed as new characters come into the picture. After the initial drag, the film turns into a highly dynamic ride of violence with bright colors, eccentric characters and cool choreography.While most of the cast fit their parts, I can't possibly understand what did Joey King do to get the leading role. The eccentric nature of the film can feel excessive at times as half the edginess ends up being pure cringe; I mean the whole Thomas the Train went from being a fun gimmick to an overbearing annoyance. The humor is split about 50/50 depending on your sense of humor and the dialogue can be laughably stupid at times.Nevertheless, all these negatives didn't ruin the overall fun experience that progressively dialed up the action while having a nice little element of "who-dun-it" with plenty of cameos. I also loved the "subtle" Fiji advertising. Naturally, Brad Pitt is the driving force behind this locomotive and he is highly enjoyable in the role of a chilled out assassin. Not much to see in the cinema nowadays but this film was definitely worth the trip.Movies.shmovies on Instagram for honest movie and TV Show reviews.

Hercule Piorot is holidaying in Egypt when he is invited aboard a cruise down the Nile. The host is the extremely wealthy, recently married, heiress Linnet Ridgeway. The journey is soured by the appearance of Jacqueline de Bellefort, the ex-flame of Ridgeway's husband. Ridgeway stole him away from her and she seems intent on extracting some sort of retribution. When Ridgeway is murdered suspicion naturally falls on de Bellefort but she has a cast iron alibi.I should have known better than to watch this having watched Kenneth Branagh's adaptation of Murder on the Orient Express. Everything about it seemed flat and listless: paint-by-numbers adaptation, minimal intrigue (especially for a murder-drama), subdued, uninspired performances (despite an all-star cast), mindless action scenes.Where Branagh did dial things up was on the cinematography and effects but even there it falls flat: all the effects just make everything seem fake. You can tell it's being filmed in a studio in front of green screen rather than out in the snow with a real train.Having watched the excellent 1974 version it was a definite sub-standard effort. It felt like the classic Christie tale had been dumbed-down for modern audiences and substance sacrificed for style.Murder on the Nile is largely more of the same: weak, dumbed-down adaptation, listless performances, style over substance. The graphics and cinematography at least feel less fake here and are in fact the only positive as they do provide a richness of colour and a vibrance to proceedings.The screenplay is cringy at times with all the unnecessary add-ons to the novel to accommodate modern viewers. Performances are shrill and irritating. Casting is off: so many dud choices. I assume Branagh only wanted French and Saunders in the film because he's a fan of them as a comedy duo, not because they were ideal for their roles (as they're not).Similar to how I ended my review of Murder on the Orient Express, watch the excellent 1978 Peter Ustinov version instead. Or watch the relevant episode in the brilliant David Suchet Poirot series. With those already in existence I don't know why this film was made.

Alone the first scene is a fine example that many of today's movie producers, writers and directors too many times don't understand much about what they write about or produce (or they just don't care - I don't know what's worse): take the first scene, the attack in the war of the trenches. The French use gas to hide themselves and instead of putting on their gas masks (well, gas is dangerous, isn' it?) and taking preparation for an attack (the use of gas almost always indicated an immediate attack), the Germans just say, hey, I can't see a thing, just lets stare around a little bit more or just keep on eating your soup. Next scene, we get some Blues tunes that are fine but, well, the movie plays in 1937, but the first electrical guitar ever build was a Rickenbacker in 1936, and the Blues style played belongs to the 40s and 50s... I just give you that two little examples to illustrate why the whole movie just feels wrong and even dumb sometimes - the characters of course behave and talk also out of time and place. Anyway, watchable, if you like the starred actors but compared to the movie of 1978, this one looks weak.
46e57#$sw%%62$45@
They tried, yes, they did, but what's most annoying about this movie is the below average acting performances. French and Dawn's appearance (not funny) dont make things any better. There are lots of silly accents and lots of scenes with over acting. Annoying.More bad:the utter tediousness of this story. It lasts a whopping 2 hours and a bit and this story only starts going after an entire hour. And even then it's quite tedious to watch.No humor. (not my kind) No suspense. Really none at all. What's left? An average detective, really below average...The story: lots of folks travel on a cruiseboat. Someone dies. Who did it?

Please, please no more remakes of what were once great movies. Kenneth Branagh has gone from bad to worse with this. Everything is so false about it, the cgi so bad. Acting is terrible, as is cast. Why do people want to make remakes of movies which were truly the best.

By comparison, this is multiple levels below recent mainstream mysteries Knives Out and Murder on the Orient Express. The mystery has some intrigue but not much. The pacing is off and it takes a while (over an hour) before the mystery actually begins. I'm not a fan of the tone or the music. The actors are frequently over-the-top, sometimes reaching cartoonish territory.Overall, this movie is not put together very well. And I found it only mildly entertaining when I wasn't bored.

46e57#$sw%%62$45@
I don't always agree with the professional critics, but I have to say that I do agree this adaption, is, without a doubt, the most turgid and poorly executed Christie adaption that there has been.There is over an hour of the film before the mystery even begins and that interminable hour consists of exposition that leave the characters as two dimensional as when it started. And half of the characters seem shoveled in with no purpose whatsoever. E.g. Sophie Okonedo. She is a great actress. Perhaps the best in this cast. I strongly recommend people see her Hollow Crown and Hotel Rwanda. But her character (or that of the character's niece) in Death on the Nile is what? Serves what plot purpose? (Answer: none)The actual "solving" of the mystery has to be the most predictable Christie adaption ever. It is a outright "Cui bono?" It makes it clear this is written for very low brow audience.

First off, great cast and amazing acting, the leads had chemistry and the emotions felt authentic. However, the score and cinematography were mediocre borderline poor. It was painfully obvious that every set was green screen. The score left too many dead moments. Also, what was with that very weird Gadot as Cleopatra moment?!
46e57#$sw%%62$45@
The opening scene tells all you need to know. Twerking dance in 1936!!! That is a sure sign of desperation which is obvious in the rest of the movie. No authenticity, horrible acting, atrocious directing. Full of horrible CGI scenery that a 10 year old can tell its fake.Save yourself money and time and watch the 1978 version with Peter Ustinov as Poirot. Or better yet see TV series played by David Suchet. Both are 100 times better and sensible that this absolute garbage of movie.
46e57#$sw%%62$45@
I suppose you could say this is a fake film for fake times.It looked surreal because it was surreal.Yes, it looked spectacular and lavish, but it was just not real.Just about everything was created on a computer, no trip to Egypt required.The day will come when CGI is so good there will be no need for actors and actresses. It will all be created by software.Rather than follow an established story with the same characters the need to force feed the viewer with PC wokery had to be catered for first.So we had, characters left out, characters introduced, names changed, genders changed, nationalities changed, ethnicity changed, same sex relationship introduced ... what a mess.Ironically, the outing of same sex relationship by Poirot in the reveal was callous and cruel. It played no part in the plot at all, in fact the portrayal of Poirot was way off the mark.Sophie Okonedo was the best thing in it, she was superb and disappointing that she was wasted in this poor adaptation.Both the TV drama (2004) and the 1978 film were better than this attempt, both being shot on location with actual REAL locations.Watch the 1978 film, it is much better and follows the original plot far more closely.

2 out of 5 stars.Death on the Nile is a boring mystery film that does not improve from its previous film. And the sequel is no better. Besides putting the film in a beautiful set piece on a boat and beautiful visual effects of the Nile river and Egypt setting.The film does have a promising cast ensemble. Kenneth Branagh does great with the role. The newcomers like Annette Being, Russell Brand, Gal Gadot, Armie Hammer, Letitia Wright and many others are all talented.The script drags the story. The direction is slow and boring. Every clue is revealed slowly, and when the twist is revealed. It is no surprise or giving you that thrill. I found the film to be boring and slow. The story is decent. The direction and script could have been so much better for a whodunit kind of film.
46e57#$sw%%62$45@
Kenneth Branagh must not have liked the original story or characters much, given all the changes he made. This is a terrible movie on many levels.Poirot is a different character. He is now a former war hero with a lost love and a romantic side. Unforgivably, Branagh creates a major departure involving Poirot's signature moustache. There is an obligatory nod to Poirot's obsession with order and symmetry, but overall this is not the character in the Christie novels. Why didn't Kenneth Branagh just create a new detective named Branagh rather than rewriting Poirot? Agatha Christie herself found her most popular character insufferable, but she never changed him to make him more "normal."Then there is the miscasting. Gal Gadot, who is always appealing but who has neither a British nor American accent, is not even remotely believable as British heiress Lynette Ridgeway. In addition, her backstory includes an instance in which she summers in Kennebunkbort, Maine. Perhaps visiting the Bush family? So she's a New Englander too!In the novel, Ridgeway's lawyer is a childhood playmate and cousin named Pennington. In this movie, he is from India and named Katdhadorian. He's supposed to be family!? An elderly woman and her caretaker on board the ship (a spinster with her nurse in Christie's original), are in a lesbian relationship.A white character in the original novel, a British writer of terrible romance novels, is transformed into a great black blues singer, Salome Otterborne, whose daughter, Rosalie, we are told, is the irresistible love interest of a British toff. It's a good thing the script tells us this, because there is no evidence of sexual attraction or infatuation on screen. Poirot delivers a paean to here, filled with white guilt, and she replies with scorn. Both of their speeches are straight out of the woke wars of the present and have nothing to do with an Agatha Christie murder mystery.Rosalie also talks about racism she one experienced at a whites-only swimming pool in the US. So it's not just Death on the Nile. It's Death on the Mississippi Burning.Does any of this sound like Agatha Christie? Or is Branagh just using her name to get moviegoers to watch a different film? None of these problems are helped by the excessive length, slow pacing and bad CGI . A new remake should be an improvement over previous remakes, but so much of the scenery in this film is digitally created, it feels like animation.Avoid this. Look for an earlier TV or film version or read the book.

If one were to compare the 2022 version with the 1978 evergreen classic of the same name then this latest one is an extreme and massive disappointment with terrible acting by everyone in the film including KB.However if one were to judge on its own then at best it's a below average movie with absolutely nothing praiseworthy at all.4/10.

Everybody's over acting like they were amateurs in a fifth grade school play. The actors running around in fancy clothes in front of green screens and cgi. The dialogue are uninspired, not realistic and not taken from the book. The characters are woke and thin as card board. I found it all to be boring and uninteresting.

Turned in her grave, on plenty occasions in this edition of the death on the nile. I guess peter ustinov wouldve kikced his anckle too cause this edition of the poirot story is made for the new generation of agathae christie fans, not grumpy old peoople like me. How could he have forgotten his stick, and forlorn his bowler hat...IMPOSSIBLE'...enjoy it for what you want, but apart from some great vantage views of the nile and some workable cgi's here and there, this wasnt more ,than looking at a stage play in the london theater district, and the sets no more than a bbc tv theater. Best of british cast, but they can not rewrite the story again.enjoy the flicks from the past,they are way better.

Just got back from watching "Death on The Nile" &amp; I'm not even lying when I say Kenneth Branagh has chosen to shoe-horn in a WW1 related backstory to show why Hercule Poirot has a moustache... As if we needed an explanation, detailing the reason for a character's facial hair.At this rate, Hollywood will be giving us an origin story for Agatha Christie's bikini wax.Seriously though, the most suspenseful thing was the unmasked woman conspicuously coughing (continuously) throughout, further down the aisle of the cinema. It's a superficial adaptation, worsened by Kenneth Branagh's artificial direction, bad VFX, amateurish continuity errors &amp; horrendous chewing of scenery by actors giving some of the worst performances of their careers.
46e57#$sw%%62$45@
Look, I really do think that Branagh is a compelling, entertainment-focused filmmaker and performer. He's usually fully committed, lively, and even somewhat imaginative. But when the material isn't good, those traits are nearly impossible to see behind his seeming obliviousness to the mediocrity on display. With Orient Express, the whodunnit plotting and characters are engaging; not so much here.
46e57#$sw%%62$45@
After all the delays (this was scheduled for December 2019, even before the pandemic!), the Armie Hammer scandal and after all this time I almost forgot Poirot was to return. But once I finally saw this movie, I felt nothing. It's directed with a classy style but with too much of CGI and modern visuals and that mix is jarring. The performances are not that good to me (Benning may be my favourite, just her) and the storyline has a few moments and a watchable resolution but the pacing drags a lot on its first hour to me. I wanted it to be better or as decent as 'Orient Express', but clearly it was not. I yet recommend everyone to see the movie and judge by themselves. It's just I felt nothing watching it and that's a shame (after all the waiting) and a sadly steady pattern very much present in mainstream nowadays.
46e57#$sw%%62$45@
I was looking forward to this movie, but turns out it's a very disappointing waste of time. This movie is only noise with card board characters. Not even worth finishing. It started with a barking dog, very bad sign, then foreign dialogue, explosions, generic characters and bad music. It got worse. Ugh.
46e57#$sw%%62$45@
From the opening shot of a CGI crow swooping through a World War One trench it is obvious this film detaches from reality and plays out like a comic book.The Egypt depicted in this film is a deserted sterile place: everything is CGI and there are hardly any extras.This is shot in a distractingly arty fashion with characters viewed from behind windows, railing or ceiling fans.There are some really gaudy, atmosphere-breaking scenes: like when a body is carried out on the shoulders of identically and immaculately dressed female crew members with the gravitas of a state funeral - but with an audience of ten.Characters are shot at extreme close up or from miles away - rarely anything in between.The script is slow and stogie, most characters just roll out monologues, sometimes whilst looking at another cast member, but rarely interacting.I am a big Christie fan and I like many of the adaptations (including the last Orient Express) but this was really dull and boring.The characters felt very flat, only existing to relay their one defining characteristic before fading into the background.This feels very much like watching someone playing a computer game, the player going from one task to the next, each character encountered programmed with the bare minimal of personality to progress the level.
46e57#$sw%%62$45@
Kenneth Branagh has a lot to answer for - not the least of which is his hubris in thinking he can improve on the brilliant Agatha Christie stories and previous screen adaptations of some of her favorite novels. Worse, Branagh changes the fundamental traits and personalty of Christie's Hercule Poirot. Where the hell does he get off? Then, he tries to compensate with overproduced, overblown "movie magic" which may impress some but not true Chritie afficionados. This is a continuation of the same tricks he tried to pull with his shameful "Murder on the Orient Express." He should be ashamed. I think the next item on his assasination list is "Evil Under the Sun." Please, God, no!

Boring and pretentious interpretation of a great story.Death on the Nile is just another in a series of unnecessary productions that just shows that today's film industry has neither the quality nor the desire to make a good film that will intrigue the viewer and keep him in suspense.With a few solid actors and a few catastrophically bad ones, this film can't offer much. The script is bad, the dialogues are forced, and the actors seem to be bored.I didn't last until the end of the film, because it was simply boring and pretentious. Every movie looks the same, even those set in the past.Writers cannot refrain from destroying the classics. The film looks artificial, with visible CGI, the practical effects still look better. Everything seems forced and shallow, but that's how most movies look today.The script is bad, with hilarious dialogues and forced situations. I was expecting at least great set design, but even that looks too fake. This may have been really interesting, but in the end, this is just another boring movie.Boring, pretentious and unimaginative.A complete waste of time.

Murder on the Orient Express it was not .That was an enjoyable movie, not great, but entertaining and well written and excecuted . And of course an excellent cast .This debacle was none of that ; a disjointed screenplay, a cast not worth remembering - an adaption of the novel you certainly do not want to remember .Cringy , forced stereotypical dialogue and characters , poor camera work, editing, and cheap green screen recording for most of the film .To add insult to injury, a diversity cast was forced into the movie, in such a hamfisted fashion, and with such unlikable characters , that ironically it will most likely have the opposite of the desired effect .Avoid - it's boring at best, annoying in many places .

I hope Agatha Christie is haunting the director, editors, and writers from beyond, for besmirching her good name. I don't blame the actors, but the first half of this way too long movie was awful. In one scene, a character info-dumped the backstories of every other character and described why they would be a suspect in a future murder that hadn't even happened yet, which was some of the worst show-don't-tell and infodump writing I've ever witnessed. The glitz and glam is gratuitous and detracts from the story at times... every frame seemed hyper-photoshopped, to the point of looking cartoonish. I don't know whether the pandemic or political tensions prohibited them from using a drone for aerial footage of Egypt, or if stock footage wasn't available, but the CGI landscapes were painfully noticeable. Dialog consisted almost entirely of pithy one-liners, and no real conversations between characters were there to help develop characters, their relationships, or the story. There were a lot of characters, and I felt connected to none of them.The second half of the movie improved a bit, but suffered from Poirot seemingly magically knowing information that hadn't been revealed to the viewers. If you show it to us and we don't catch on until Poirot explains it, that's on us and is part of the thrill. If you don't show it, or show it only in retrospect, then I fault the movie makers for making the movie seem far-fetched and for me losing interest.
46e57#$sw%%62$45@
Branagh's "Murder on the Orient Express" was crap. Thirty minutes into "Death on the Nile" and I could see that it was going to be just as bad. Opening scenes were pointless but I patiently waited for the meat of the film to begin and it was just as full of silliness as his previous attempt to do a Poirot movie.Perhaps someone should inform Branagh that bizarre doesn't always work, especially if it's not done well.
46e57#$sw%%62$45@
Did enjoy this, but having read the book by Agatha Christie I can say that you should read the book instead. For a 2 hour movie it does not develop the characters or story very well but cinematography and direction is spectacular.

Maybe, it helps that I didn't watch The Rescue prior to seeing the film, but Ron Howard's work is excellent nonetheless. The film doesn't waste any time getting to its "rescue mission" core, bringing in the likes of Viggo Mortensen, Colin Farrell, and eventually Joel Edgerton to help tell this thrilling and utterly grounded tale. Howard ensures that the film doesn't forget where it is set, allowing the region's culture to breathe life into its Thai characters as opposed to showcasing just white sentiment.The major highlight, as you expect, is the underwater cinematography (by Sayombhu Mukdeeprom) which plays an essential role in making us gasp for breath often and inducing claustrophobic feels. William Nicholson's script plays out chronologically, adding more gravity to the events. The melodrama is kept to a bare minimum, and the narrative is very matter-of-fact. Benjamin Wallfisch's score infuses itself into the fantastic sound design, making it indistinguishable from the sounds of water splashing, diving helmets hitting rock, and oxygen cylinders being dragged along. It's 2.5 hours long, and you already know the ending, but it's still one of the finest films this year.

Despite the fact the we all know how things are going to turn out, Ron Howard pulls off the same trick he managed in Apollo 13, which is to keep us on the edge of our seats throughout.The film is very deliberately shot from the point of view of the outside world. We learn very little about the boys, and none is introduced to us as an individual. Indeed, they vanish from the screen from the moment they enter the caves to the moment the first divers make contact - just as they vanished in real life. I was irked by this approach at first - the boys being reduced to mere ciphers, but then it dawned on me that that's what they were to the news-feeds of the time: twelve unknown boys (plus their coach) trapped in cave in a country a long way away.The performances are excellent throughout, the direction first-class, and the sense of claustrophobia almost overwhelming at times. I admit to wondering whether there would be a side-swipe at Elon Musk for being a publicity-seeking nuisance, but there wasn't. This was probably the right decision.Any time I turn on the news, I can hear about humanity at its worst. It's nice to hear the odd story about humanity at its best.

I absolutely loved this film by Ron Howard! Thirteen Lives is based on the true story of thirteen people who got stuck in a flooded cave in Thailand in the summer of 2018. The storyline is action-packed and extremely suspenseful. It felt like my heart was racing a million miles a minute while I watched it.Thirteen Lives takes us on the journey of twelve boys and their soccer coach getting stuck in the Tham Luang cave in northern Thailand. The boys wanted to visit the cave; however, little did they know that there was an approaching monsoon that would soon after flood the entire cave. People from all over the world were watching their rescue attempt with the many challenging obstacles they had to overcome. Will someone find them inside the cave? If they do, will the boys get out of the cave in time before they starve, or run out of oxygen?The acting in this film is phenomenal. The portrayal of these young boys, their coach and their rescuers is so believable that you feel like you are there along with them. The cast includes Colin Farrell as John Volanthen, Viggo Mortensen as Richard Stanton, Joel Edgerton as Richard Harris and Tom Bateman as Chris Jewell. The production team, led by director Ron Howard also delivered. The way the film is made makes you feel like you're actually in the cave with the rescue workers. It took a lot of effort and coordination, which is very impressive. Over 5,000 people, including cave divers, doctors, rescuers, Navy SEALS, farmers and others contributed to helping the boys. They put their own lives at risk to help the boys and their coach, whom they didn't even know! Without those people playing a part in this rescue who knows if they would have saved them. My favorite part is when the farmers give up their crops so water can flood them and divert the water from going into the cave. It took a lot of heroism and sacrifice to lose their entire crop in order to give the boys a better chance of surviving.The message of this film is that working together is essential. You should be aware that there is a lot of blood in some scenes and there is some bad language used a couple of times.I give Thirteen Lives 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 12 to 18, plus adults. This film releases in select theaters on July 29, 2022, and starts streaming on Prime Video August 5, 2022. By Selene W., KIDS FIRST!

I saw The film at a preview screening with cast today. I implore you, if you can see this movie at a theater, please do so. The experience isn't the same. Really phenomenal film. It's from the perspective of the rescue mission, so be prepared about that. It was so intense and stressful to watch! You know the story but actually watching what happened is much worse. It's really heartbreaking at times. I thought I would cry more but I burst into tears at the end. I think they were tears of relief honestly. Lol I had been holding in so much stress. Everyone in the film did a phenomenal job and the character Viggo played, Rick, was at our screening. So much respect for
This man and all the others who stayed calm under pressure! I only took a point away because the movie gets started practically right away And I would have liked a little more connection to the boys first. Maybe that was the point though.

Once again Viggo and Colin prove they're among the best in the business. Farrell is so good at transforming himself and he's consistent here. The movie takes few if any liberties for the sake of drama but maintains a taught narrative throughout.What the divers achieved in that rescue was nothing short of a miracle and kudos to Howard for crafting a movie that gives this story all the respect it's due.

This is by far the best movie I have seen on prime video. Good for them to put it up for us. A real movie that everyone can enjoy. And we all know there is a real happy ending. This is a movie about hero's not superhero just regular people being real life hero's.

I am Thai and I went through that time with my eyes glued to news channels and reports. Knowing the outcome doesn't effect the experience much at all. That's how good they made this movie. All the details, the sacrifices, the volunteering and the effort portrayed in this movie was just superb. Ron Howard's Apollo 13 comes to mind. We all knew the outcome but damn were we still on the edge of our seats.

I'm a scuba diver and well aware of the technical challenges of Cave Diving. I'm also well versed in the rescue of these boys having read two books and seen the previous documentaries. What's great about this movie is that it presents the emotional response of the parents and the divers, especially Harry and John and how they had to cope in an incredibly dynamic and challenging situation, moreso above the water, than in the water.
46e57#$sw%%62$45@
First of all, how are they even shooting this dive scenes inside the caves &amp; all ? It was absolutely well done with such a well acted cast. I love all these underrated cast, Viggo Mortensen, Colin Farrell, Joel Edgerton, &amp; Tom Bateman. These amazing cast not only have to potray a character, but has to physically did the stunt performances. Very thrilling &amp; stress to watch not knowing it was that level of difficulty since we've only heard from the news. One of the best inspired survival stories I've seen !

One thing is certain, Ron Howard certainly knows how to make this kind of film, and this is his best in a while and maybe his best ever. Brilliantly made and well paced, capturing all if the emotion and tension of an incredible rescue and international effort. I have previously watched the (also) excellent Nat Geo documentary and this film mirrors that well and adds no typical Hollywood drama to it at all. Truly excellent viewing.
46e57#$sw%%62$45@
Ron Howard is one of the most under rated directors working today. He is almost workman-like in the way he directs. No frills, no unnecessary story lines and rarely, if ever, any manipulation of the story. In Thirteen Lives, he sticks to what he does best - presents the facts and lets the story build its own suspense. For a movie that, I presume, most folks know the ending, this movie will keep you totally engrossed as you ride the roller coaster of emotions that all involved felt. From the distraught families to the mentally and physically drained rescuers, no one escaped without being overcome by the sheer enormity of an attempt to save the lives of these thirteen individuals.This movie is taut and well paced with little or no filler. The actors were all extremely believable in their rolls. The sets and the action sequences were beyond reproach.Having said all that, I would like to give special praise to the sound engineers. The sound when the divers were in the cave attempting to do the impossible was truly worthy of Academy Award considerationI cannot recommend this movie more highly. It is one wet and wild ride.

Thirteen Lives (2022)It seems like the filmstagram community's number one priority in regards to this film is to state how a documentary called "The Rescue" is much better. Well, personally I haven't seen the documentary and considering how long ago this story took place, I didn't even remember what the outcome was. Quite frankly, the less you know about this story, the more enjoyable the movie is going to be. There were only three things I knew for certain: the film is based on a true story of saving a group of kids stuck in a cave, it is directed by Ron Howard and it has Viggo Mortensen and Colin Farrell.In about 10 minutes we are introduced to a football team, see them enter the cave and after that it's all hands on deck as the operation begins. There are no big monologues or grand debates as the movie aims to create a grounded atmosphere and allow the audience the be as close to the events as possible. An emotion that I kept experiencing, on top claustrophobia, is a sense of admiration for the courage, skill and endurance of these divers. That point is further accentuated whenever the film uses mapping to show the twisted path in terms of length and the time it takes to swim it.One strong element of this movie is how it shows the impact of volunteering and the importance of receiving as much help as possible. While the divers risked their lives, everyone else put in the effort to ease their burden. The actors often seemed like they have been diving their entire lives because of how naturally they were portraying their roles. As a result, the moments of sadness, joy and intense stress will allow you to slip into the wet suits of those divers to be as in-touch with the experience as possible.Heroism and selflessness are always a winning formula and when it's based on true events, while being filmed with the expert skills of Ron Howard, it leaves a very pleasant aftertaste.Movies.shmovies on Instagram for honest movie and TV Show reviews.

This was better than expected. Could have gone sideways in so many fashions but resists at every turn to become soapish or maudlin or fall into action flick tropes but it does not. In Ron Howard's able hands this amazing true story comes alive with intrigue and emotion. And clocking in at 2 1/2 hours, for me it did not feel overlong or slow.

I watched the documentary the Rescue several months ago. I already knew a lot of the story and the amazing people involved. Perhaps, if I saw 13 for the first time I might have given it an 8 or 9. But there is nothing compared to the actual people giving their own account of the rescue in their own words. Footage of every aspect of the rescue. The real faces and voices of the boys and their coach.This movie pays a nice tribute to that spectacular feat of humanity all joining to save these unlucky souls. But I feel it was a day late and a dollar short when comparing to the documentaries.

I'm glad that I'd seen The Rescue (2021) before coming upon this dramatization of the actual event that is just too incredible to be true. You get to know the real heroes of this story in person. They portray the divers as kooky misfits who just happen to be the best cave divers in the world and the only men who could have pulled this off. The Rescue tells their story in their own, self-deprecating words.With that said, this film was excellent and the casting was spot on. Viggo Mortensen and Colin Farrel looked a lot like the real players.When I watched the documentary I had no idea how the story ended making the film really agonizing and heart-breaking to watch. I suggest that you at least read up on the story before venturing down into this black hole of nightmarish horror, and I'm not even particularly claustrophobic. If this fear is deeply imbedded in your psyche, I'd avoid this movie, and definitely skip "The Rescue" that has real footage of some caving and cave diving that caused me to hyperventilate.

The cast, screenplay and director captivated my attention from the get-go. An outstanding, empathic trip through the creative minds telling a true story. One of the top 10 movies I've seen in a lifetime. (I'm an avid movie fan) Bravo!

Greetings again from the darkness. It is 2018 and a group of boys have just finished soccer practice. After some motivational words from their coach, the boys start joking around with one of their teammates who has a birthday party slated for later that day. Boys being boys, they decide to bike over the local cave for some pre-party exploring. Their coach tags along to keep an eye on them. All of that sounds innocent enough until we realize this is the Tham Luang cave, and they don't realize Thailand's monsoon season is about to arrive early and with full force.The film is directed by Oscar winner Ron Howard, who is adept at mainstream storytelling as evidenced by APOLLO 13 (1994), A BEAUTIFUL MIND (2001), and CINDERELLA MAN (2005). The script was penned by William Nicholson (GLADIATOR, 2000) and Don MacPherson (THE AVENGERS, 1998), and tells the all-too-true story of the daring rescue mission that most of recall following on news reports. When the boys were no-shows for the birthday party, parents and friends rushed to the cave to find the bicycles, but not the 12 boys and their coach. Immediately, rescue efforts began with Thai Navy SEALS rushing to the sight. Cave diving is a unique skill practiced by only a few, and is much different than the open water diving in which the SEALS excel.British cave divers John Volanthen (Colin Farrell) and Rick Stanton (Viggo Mortensen) are called in. Volanthen is the father of a son, and can't help but empathize with what the parents must be going through, while Stanton is crusty old geezer who admits to not liking kids, while also understanding he's one of the few on earth capable of making the necessary dive. Once the two men reach the stranded boys and coach, it becomes apparent that, as difficult and challenging it was to find the group, getting them out of the cave seems all but impossible. Death hung heavy over the operation of last resort, which included calling in Dr. Harry Harris (Joel Edgerton), a cave diving hobbyist, and more importantly, an anesthetist.The diving scenes are expertly filmed by DP Sayombhu Mukdeeprom and underwater camera operator Tyrone Canning. The ever-present claustrophobia and risk of disaster underscores how courageous these men were. Director Howard offers up multiple perspectives: the government, the military, the divers, and the parents. We get very little from those trapped, but that adds to the tension. We get a feel for the entire operation as water is being pumped out of the cave, a water expert and volunteers frantically divert new rainwater into the rice fields, and political maneuvering occurs as the outgoing Governor (Sahajak Boonthankakit) is being set up as fall guy in case the efforts fail.So many elements could have caused failure - low oxygen levels in the cave, a brisk current of water making diving more difficult, and obviously too much rainwater entering the cave would endanger the boys and the divers. The rescue mission lasted more than two weeks. It's a disaster movie based on a real event, and follows up the excellent 2021 documentary, THE RESCUE. Evidently the dramatization is for those who don't watch or have access to documentaries, and as strong as Howard's movie is, there is simply no way for it to eclipse the documentary or what occurred in real time. At its best, the film offers tension and a reminder of what can be accomplished with collaboration.Available on PRIME VIDEO beginning August 5, 2022.

Ron Howard does not hang around for Thirteen Lives.It is not long after 12 Thai schoolboys finish a game of football and then they are trapped in a cave as a monsoon descends.While trapped, attention turns to a team of specialist cave rescuers led by Rick Stanton (Viggo Mortensen) and John Volanthen (Colin Farrell) who locate the boys.The next problem is to how to bring the boys out to safety as they have swim underwater, through tight spaces and with oxygen tanks.Based on real life events from 2018. Ron Howard has a sure touch given that the outcome is well known.He uses all the tricks from his 40 years plus directing career to keep the tension going.It is slightly overlong, but there is enough peril along the way.
46e57#$sw%%62$45@
I'm familiar with the story but I was still on the edge of my seat for much of this film. Howard has a way of spotlighting the emotional details and he didn't disappoint here. Rather than objectively looking on, we're brought in to the minutia behind the scenes and the intellectual threads among the divers as well as the enormous courage, perseverance, &amp; strength that was required of them. This film really involves the viewer to understand what a Herculean effort this rescue was by thousands of people who worked to exhaustion and then kept going. Amazing. These are true heroes.What Howard leaves out, though, is the extremeness of the cave passages, presumably to open the film to a broader audience (watching cavers going through such narrow passages can be very claustrophobic). But in reality, getting to the boys took 6 hours, not because of the length of the canal but because of the extraordinarily narrow passages and difficulty in maneuvering with their equipment. I would recommend The Rescue to get a better understanding of the actual caves and the extreme difficulty of traversing through them.The majority of cave deaths in the US occur in Florida inside flooded caves. Out of 161 known cave deaths in the US, 67 were experienced cavers (not to be confused with spelunkers who are beginner to intermediate hobbyists). There isn't much data on cave deaths outside the US but probably much higher. Most countries don't have the detailed records the US has.But having said that, this rescue would not have been possible in the US due to the severe restrictions on what processes could be implemented. Such as with John Johns - They declined to forcefully pull him out because the toxins could have then rushed to his brain and caused instant death. Therefore, despite imminent death without such a bold and risky attempt, they struggled for hours to try to save him within the confines of extreme limitations set forth due to the massive lawsuits pursued by those who survive but with complications and/or who die due to extreme attempts that later may appear negligent to the family. I love my country but as someone interested in things like extreme sports I am disgusted by the squeaky wheels who impose limitations on what people can or can not do based on, often uneducated, opinion. In the US, all 13 would have likely become casualties of a decision to not allow the method these cavers dared to use.No one really talks about that but if you're a caver and you know Jone's story, you have to ask the question: Why weren't they more aggressive. That's why.

Holy moly.... now I know why! He's claustrophobic and I am not but YIKES, I need multiple breaks watching this extremely intense movie. I was fine at first but how many times have they gone into that cave? The map with distance and time made it much worse.Wow, well done. I gave an 8/10 for now while on my break. Paused it... and shikes ... I still got an hour to go.
46e57#$sw%%62$45@
I know the story after reading about it in the press and watching a documentary about it. That said, what I really wanted to experience was the view from the inside. It isn't often that total strangers step up and volunteer not only thier time, but thier expertise and possibly thier very lives. Finally, Amazon have hit one out of the park.This movie reminds me of Ford v ferrari where the right blend of actors baked into a true story results in a really great movie. It's amazing what humanity can do when we all come together.
46e57#$sw%%62$45@
At the beginning i though, the storyline was going too fast... at the first quarter almost the kids were trapped. Eventually i figured out, that was the right way, to focus at the rescue part than anything else.. It was so realistic that sometimes i felt i was there in the cave, i was thinking about what needs to be done, actually sometimes i got claustrophobia from the outstanding direction and the scenes under the water. I remember that incident 4 years ago, i 've seen it in Greece news but actually i had no idea about the details of the story. Must see for everyone who likes 'based on true story' movies !! So emotional ending !

I enjoyed this movie even tho it was a bit predictable. Very good story, the music was great BUT her singing was annoying! I could only understand 1/2 the words. Stop trying to be so breathy. Just sing.
46e57#$sw%%62$45@
This is like a bad hallmark movie... As a veteran myself and someone who reviews veteran's military discharges everyday I can 100% tell you that the main character would not get a bad conduct discharge for this. He is married. It doesn't matter what his intentions were, as long as he is married he is entitled to the benefits that come with it and so is she. The idea that this movie even exists bothers me to no end. Completely inaccurate on multiple levels.
46e57#$sw%%62$45@
I wanted to like it, was hoping to enjoy it as a lighthearted cheesy romance - but I could not sit through any more cringey liberal and conservative stereotypes. No one talks like this. It was painful to watch and a little too cliché for my liking.
46e57#$sw%%62$45@
Ok it might be predictable but the development of the characters is slow and realistic, and you witness how they end up caring deeply for one another.Good acting as well.It is better than the usual romcom movies that netflix produces.
46e57#$sw%%62$45@
I really wanted to like this movie. The chemistry was off in all scenes. The singing was horrible especially the opening song. A little to political for me and not very believable... This movie just didn't work...

Nicholas Galitzine is excellent in every movie I've seen of his, but I feel like he's never gotten the right role in the right movie at the right time to propel him to the proper level of success and status which he deserves. I don't want to get into the negative opinions I have about this movie. I think its flaws are apparent, and I don't think it's necessary to drag down the hard work everyone clearly did. I just wish Nicholas was given a meatier role in a A-list project, so more people could appreciate his talent.
46e57#$sw%%62$45@
Purple Hearts is messy. The political and socialist commentary that the film starts off with is dropped half way through for a romance story that's unrealistic given the differences between both characters established at the beginning of the movie.Are we really suppose to believe that a man who views a girl as a "liberal nut" is going to fall in love with her? Likewise, are we suppose to believe that a liberal latina is going to fall in love with a conservative white man who dislikes her views?Apparently, yes, because the guy get's injured in combat and the girl nurses him back to health and they eventually forget why they disliked each other at first due to some insane plot armour. The writing was not good.The use of several romance tropes like marriage of convenience, enemies to loves, and long distance relationships helps to create palpable chemistry between the leads but it isn't enough to ignore the plot holes in this movie. I'm begging writers to STOP including social/political commentary in their work if they aren't going to do it right.
46e57#$sw%%62$45@
It seems like whomever wrote this knows nothing about how the military works (from deployments, to advance pay, credit unions, etc.). It's the typical tropes that are meant to add to the story but become a distraction.As is usually the case with Netflix, I'm forced to sit through a political lecture with a side portion of a movie, as opposed to a movie that makes some political points. The "mean girl" routine by the lead actress gets old with the angry feminist activist routine. The writers fail to see the contradiction of the way she behaves with the "be kind" bumper sticker.The acting is better than average for their movies, which is still not great. The story is ok, but predictable and somewhat lackluster. The side story line with the drug dealer and resulting court martial gets old and is borderline ridiculous. The politics take away from the story because it's constant and over the top as opposed to adding to the story through nuance.Not a terrible watch, but not recommended. It's forgettable.

To start this review off I will say that yes the ending was predictable, along with a lot of what I knew would happen; Like them getting caught, realizing they've actually fallen in love over the course of the movie and having a happy ending after all is said and done.However none of it caused me to dislike the movie or find it boring. I looked at it more in the eyes of a romance style film because I'm a romantic and I love happy endings. So for me personally, while certain events may have been predictable and I knew they were coming I still thoroughly enjoyed the movie. The storyline itself was solid and I liked it, nothing overly complicated or mind blowing but perfect for this little romance that is introduced to us via the film.The acting was really great; I've seen Sofia Carson in a few other titles and I've always liked her performances. She is also really beautiful, though her acting skill is not reliant on her stunning looks and she is actually a very talented actress looks aside. She also has a wonderful voice and can really sing irl, this leads to some great songs being performed in the movie by her. The supporting cast was all great as well, with the only performance that I felt was slightly on the blander side being that of the actor playing Luke Morrow. It wasn't bad by any means but just a bit on the slightly blander side. He seems to only have like 3 different facial expressions which he swops between throughout the movie, except for a few spots when Sofia/Cassie seems to bring out a genuine smile/laugh from him.Seeing movies like this really just reinforces the idea that someone special is out there for me, for everyone. All we hear about nowadays is the massive divorce rate and how most marriages fail. But seeing the happiness on a couples faces (At the end of the movie) really gives one hope. This movie doesn't have a massive budget or all star cast but it has its own unique charm and makes my heart go along with Luke and Cassie on their journey to find out they are each others special someone.I will definitely be re-watching this movie later and if a sequel is ever made sign me up! I'll finish off my review by saying this movie gets a well deserved 10/10 from me but may not be everyone's cup of tea.

An unrealistic plot-line which was made-up in five minutes. An obsession with her 'career' being successful as an recording artist but it never really making sense.Like from a pub gig to a sold-out Hollywood Bowl gig (where legacy acts play) in x number of months? A weird focus on military life. Why would you have straight video chats inside an ops' room? It'll be in private dorms. Some super-weird casting for military personal extras in those cut-scenes.She can sing yes but it's very forced. The band are not that good at all. It's a bit weird. It doesn't work. The jealous drug dealer always wanting money and never getting it yet you get paid in service.The chemistry is forced. Like one minute they're super "in love" then they're not at all. It's very mundane. The marines and characters are stereotyped. There's a lot of stereotyping in this film.The 'we're still in Iraq' thing doesn't work for a 2021 film. In 2019 troops started pulling out. There's a few thousand left to train the local security forces so none of the touring made sense.I'm glad that the film is covering diabetes - which is a major problem. However it's doing it in a glamourous and unrealistic way which makes any education difficult-to-believe.A very average straight-to-Netflix film.

There is too much hate in the world already and give this romantic movie a break y'all. First, why be so critical on a romantic movie? I just don't get it. The movie is like a breather especially when you have seen a lot of serious movies or series. Appreciate the simplicity and immense yourself into something that somehow would allow yourself to escape reality. Who wouldn't like to have a love story like theirs? This movie tells us how great it is to have someone who really loves us and I guess the poor critiques are all so bitter enough that they fail to see the beauty of falling in love or they are too serious with their lives having no time for some love.And the actors here really did a fantastic job! They mirror the realities of true people - that in life it is not always a happy day. You can really feel the hurt in their acting. It's like a rollercoaster ride with them.I wished though it could have been longer. Like what we say in the Philippines, it's "Bitin". But, still a good movie. Watch this!

This one does not pay slightest attention to details and looses all authenticity. A singer that cannot really sing, nobody of the crew did research on diabetes.

Formulaic? Absolutely.Did it pioneer new territory? No.But beyond that did it check the marks for the genre? Yes.Two leads that devour the camera, have realistic (current) differences and evolve. And most importantly- it doesn't overthink itself. It's a story about two people that find their way. And that's enough for me- and should be for nearly anyone of the genre.Heck- the soundtrack was great (kudos) as and added bonus.
46e57#$sw%%62$45@
A story about redemption and finding light in each other, in the total differences. Love in the fire of growth and change. This film has so much heart, chemistry, and genuine feeling I was totally mesmerised and any faults just melted away. I cannot tell you one and encourage you not to look for them, rather be swept up in the ride........ Sofia Carson and Nicholas Galitzine are stunning together and the whole cast is memorable. I will look for these actors from hereon.....

I didn't have high expectations for this, but I ended up actually kind of enjoying it. The story itself is sweet, I liked the tension between the main characters. The acting was great and the pacing was pretty good too. It was a little predictable, but nothing too bad.The two main characters obviously had some differences in opinions and values, but still ended up falling for each other. This is sweet and all, but I just hoped they had explored that more. I mean, their values are in direct conflict, because they're literally the opposite from each other. And they never seemed to find any common ground, there was no chemistry in their conversations. This all made the ending feel a little unbelievable.
46e57#$sw%%62$45@
I gave it a chance and watched it to the end. Its very predictable all the way through. Many of the songs are old hits until she write her own songs, which isn't good. I think she is a terrible singer, which would never get a hit song in real life.And the soldiers have public "private" calls, so everyone can hear them...And why would the marinens care about if he is married or not. I bet a lot of marines get married before a tour and I also don't think the marines have much idea about marines gf or bf...It would only be a problem, if he gets reporter by his team mate. But no, he gets reported by a drug dealer and the marine, which the male actor is stupid enough to tell the truth to..And is $2.000 for being married really a thing? It sounds like a lot of extra money. No wonder he tries to cheat... And there did he suddenly get the money to pay of the drug dealer? He should just have paid him off earlier and nothing would have happened...I bet there would be insurance money for getting wounded too... why not just the the guy that, so again it wouldn't be a problem...I think it's a very unrealistic movie with a lot if factually mistake and in real life, they most likely would have gotten away with it, if they had been smart about it...

This movie was quite enjoyable to watch but it had some flaws. Good things: 1. The songs in this movie were good. I'm not familiar with singer and actress Sofia Carson who plays Cassie. She has a lovely voice. 2. The two lead actors had ok chemistry. 3. The movie had a nice flow to it. Bad things: 1. Why couldn't Cassie try a little harder to make this fake marriage look real? Within a few hours of marrying Luke she's arguing with him in front of his friends and colleagues. 2. Why would anyone believe some random rough looking drug dealer who says that Luke and Cassie are in a fake marriage? Where was his evidence? All Luke had to say was he was lying and had no proof. 3. Cassie could have been a little nicer to Luke. The guy helped her and was putting his career, freedom and reputation on the line. She felt resentful that he had to stay in her apartment and made him sleep on the couch with a serious injury. 4. Why kill off their friend Frankie? He was a sweet guy and I would have liked to see him later in the movie getting married to his girlfriend. 5. It was a pretty predictable movie, especially the ending where the two leads finally admit they have feelings for each other. I would have liked to see more passion and emotion from them.
46e57#$sw%%62$45@
This movie ended on a high. But to get to this point you had to watch the most insufferable female character in history. Sofia Carson's character was so incredibly selfish and unlikeable. I found myself yelling " What a B" too many times. The male lead was great. It just wasn't a romance movie that left you with a satisfying feeling at the end. As other viewers commented her making a wounded vet sleep on the sofa, giving him a hard time while he's trying to recover and being mad that he didn't tell her about his debt when it was her idea that they break the law to begin with. She was just gross. Her redemption at the end wasn't enough to save this character. Sofia should really stop choosing parts where she is so narcissistic. She's starting to typecast herself.

Yes I had to bring up Nicholas Sparks coz if anyone remembers Nicholas Sparks's Rom-coms were a genre of their own and this movie reminded me exactly of those movies which we all love to see in a weekend but hate to admit. What I liked about this movie is that it knows that it is a feel good rom-com and it is committed to it. I felt good because it turned out better than I expected it to be. Bonus for using that dreamy sunlight glow filter in the movie which made it look like an actual movie not like a TV movie.They said rom-coms are dead , sadly for theatres they are dead but this kind of faithful good attempts make me hopeful for this genre .P. S- The both actors did a pretty good job, they made me rooting for them by the end of the movie.

I knew It was Going to be bad within the first minute. The Marines are in San Diego singing cadence about Parris Island which is in South Carolina. They lost me there but I still gave it some more time. The acting is terrible. The script is terrible. Only a person who truly loves romance shows could overlook how horrible this is And give it a high rating. All others avoid.

Im not sure why young female artist have to sing this way. I can barely understand what she is saying?? Why do they do the breathy baby crooning? Its hard to enjoy the songs. Shes not untalented, just annoying. Also am i supposed to believe these two come together after their clear stances on political views. I see what Netflix tried to do and don't know that it worked. Dont get me started on the military taking the word of a blitz out drug dealer...i literally facepalmed! But i did manage to watch the whole thing, so theres that?? Its okay for what it is.
46e57#$sw%%62$45@
Well, I won't lie, the visuals were good, not exceptionally magical, but it was acceptable, the soundtrack, ok, the scenario, I can work with that, maybe a little rushed but I can live with it, I liked the political perspectives of both leads clashing, it was funny sometimes.What I hated that there were literally zero consequences for what the heroine's actions! Like the only thing she got was a pat on the back, indirectly! The hero got his legs blown, he was shamed, humiliated, belittled, then he got locked in jail for six months and was kicked out of the military, while our lovely heroine got her free medical insurance, became a mega famous rock/pop star??? Seriously?? Yes he got money too from the fake marriage, but it was all so that he could protect his family and her!She was so selfish when he was forced to live with her at first, my dude got his legs in tatters and was afraid of military persecution, but no how could he take her personal space and leave her with the consequences of marrying a marine for money *surprised pickatchu face* and she gave a special needs person the couch to sleep in? I thought she advocated for the needs of helpless people...Also, like why would the military take the word of drug dealer???? Suspicious man, with no evidence???Why couldn't the hero and heroine say that no their marriage is real, they had so many witnesses confirming the legitimacy of their marriage or am I missing something here?And then there's Franky, my poor man Franky, was killed off, mourned and forgotten about in the span of 5 minutes :( never to be brought up ever again.I liked and hated this movie at the same time.

Loved Sofia Carson in Descendants, her voice isn't the best but the song..."Come Back Home" is beautiful and feels so original. She puts a lot of passion in her singing, at times a little too much, I mean she isn't Freddy Mercury......rest of the soundtrack is actually really good!I loved the showing of two different worlds in todays terms, because politics is how we are divided these days!The movie was sad and funny and happy ending.The only issue I had with the story was why would the military just take the word of a known civilian scumbag drug dealer and go after a decorated marine like that? Totally stupid
They're still married, and physically together and romantically......it isn't like it's an immigration situation. Who cares what that guy says?
46e57#$sw%%62$45@
This was pretty darn good. It's definitely a romantic, fictional-based story in every sense of the imagination but still oh so cheesy good! A must watch for the hopeless romantic who wishes to stay hopeless in reality but hopeful in fictional love storylines.

It's probably not the best biopic ever made but I personally loved this take on Elvis. I loved that it exposed The Colonel's abuse and gave some insight to just how much Elivs worked for the benefit of others. He took care of everyone.I'm not gonna give a long review. I just wanted to share how good I thought it was. Austin Butler deserves an award for how brilliant he was in this role. I saw where some reviewers were complaining about him not looking closely enough like Elvis but I thought he was a nice fit. There was only one Elvis folks. We just have to work with what we have and as I mentioned, I believe Austin deserves an award. He put serious thought and effort into playing this role. He wasn't hard on the eyes either!! Great Job!!Loved it!

Elvis is a movie everyone needs to see! One of the greatest biopics is finally here and it does not disappoint. Fans of all generations will love this film for years to come.Elvis is told from the point of view of Colonel Parker (Tom Hanks) who used to be Elvis's manager. He tells the story of how he met Elvis (Austin Butler) and how the singer took the world by storm. The film covers the years of Elvis's life as a young adult until his passing.This is an incredible and exciting film. From the opening scene until the credits roll, the movie is a roller coaster of emotions. Austin's performance as the king of Rock n Roll is revolutionary. It's impossible to take your eyes off of him. He truly becomes Elvis with his mannerisms and dancing. Austin's performance is Oscar-worthy, just like the rest of the film. The movie humanizes Elvis, where audiences see him as more than just a performer. It's heartbreaking to see how this larger-than-life legend never lived the life he wanted. The film unites both Elvis fans and non-enthusiasts by showing this icon in a never-before-seen profile. Following Elvis throughout his life and witnessing his love of music made me feel as if he's been a friend of mine for years. Producer/Director/Writer, Baz Lurhmann delivers an incredible film and story here. It is completely engaging, has a perfect mix of modern music and Elvis classics, along with swapping between Elvis and the Colonel's points of view. Archival elements such as newspaper headlines and comic book art are put to good use and the film ends with a video recording of Elvis's last concert. The costumes are spectacular. The scene of Elvis's Las Vegas residency wearing his iconic white suit is beautiful since it looks like the viewers are watching a live performance. This is one movie that you should watch in theaters to capture its greatness. The music blaring; Austin's acting; and the cinematography should be experienced on the big screen.Elvis offers several themes, but the most important one is to live the life you want to. Elvis's mother warned him of living a life to please others and that he would eventually lose himself, which is exactly what happened. Elvis never lived his life for himself and, in the end, it consumed him.I give Elvis 5 out 5 stars and recommend it for ages 12 to 18 plus adults. It premieres in theaters June 24, 2022.

My Review Baz Lurhmann's - ElvisMy Rating 7.5 /1010/10 for Austin Butler's portrayal as ElvisElvis has the Baz Lurhmann brand all over it as it's bound to seeing Baz wrote the story as well as Directed and Produced the movie . Whether that's a good thing or not I'm not so sure but top marks for his choice of Austin Butler to play the title role of Elvis Presley.Austin Butler had big shoes to fill and Elvis fans won't be disappointed as he portrays the iconic singer over more than 20 years of his life covering the 50s, 60s, and 70s, eras from his childhood and meteoric rise to stardom to his long, slow decline.This biographical movie unlike the 2019 movie Judy I'm pleased to say covers the good years as well as the sad years when Elvis left us tragically aged only 42 under identical circumstances to Judy Garland who was 47.Both stars burnt out prematurely both were exploited but their fame and legacy of music and film footage will live on for centuries as they are both true historical cultural icons.Austin Butler really does hold the entire movie together for me he gives much more than an Elvis impersonation which so many performers have done before.At times and at certain camera angles Austin Butler looks uncannily identical to Elvis Presley and he sings the early Elvis songbook in his own voice to perfection. Austin's voice is only blended with Elvis's own voice in the later Las Vegas years .Many other actors in addition to Austin Butler auditioned for the role including Ansel Elgort, Miles Teller, Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Harry Styles but the right choice to play Elvis certainly was Austin Butler in my opinion.Unlike Rami Malik who played Freddie Mercury in Bohemian Rhapsody and had the Freddie Mercury teeth he wore cast in gold , Austin Butler's transformation really just relies on eye make up ,hairstyle and the tight pants and flamboyant shirts and capes that Elvis wore during his performances.I'm certain Austin Butler's performance is what prompted the Elvis movie to receive a 12 minute standing ovation at the Cannes Film Festival last month. Rami Malik received an Oscar and lip synched the songs so Austin Butler who sings in his own voice should at least get a Best Actor Oscar nomination in 2023.There were positives I liked in Baz Luhrmann's Elvis and negatives as much as I admire Tom Hanks as an Actor the role of Colonel Tom Parker who is the storyteller through whose eyes we see the rise and fall of The King of Rock is a despicable and ugly character . While of course he is a central character in the Elvis Presley story I felt telling the story through such an unsympathetic character was unnecessary and I found Tom Hanks Dutch accent and his prosthetic nose a little irritating at times.The Cinematography by Mandy Walker is stunning as are the costumes by Baz Luhrmann's 4 time Academy Award winning wife Catherine Martin .All biography movies stretch or modify the facts to a certain extent to add more dramatic content and while this story is reasonably accurate Baz has used some poetic licence in some scenes . The emotional meeting of Elvis and the Producer Steve Binder of his 1968 Christmas comeback show at the iconic rusting L. A. Hollywood sign never happened but it's effective.The opening introduction scene of Colonel Tom Parker discovering Elvis at the Carnival which I'm sure was inspired by Guillermo del Toro's recent movie Nightmare Alley also never occurred. World events of that time are used as a timeline like the assassination of Bobby Kennedy during taping of an Elvis television show also are fiction but it does add drama to the script.There's also a silly hysterical scene where an entire Christmas snow set is built to convince The Colonel that Elvis was going to sing Here Comes Santa Claus in his 1968 comeback show this also apparently was a complete fiction as was the fact that Elvis was persuaded by Parker to enlist in the army rather than being arrested for his suggestive stage gyrations. Elvis did not enlist he was drafted and surrounded by the media when he entered the Army in March 1958.Those who love Showman Baz Luhrmann's flamboyant highly individual directing style I'm sure will love Elvis I enjoyed it but didn't love it.The supporting cast that includes Olivia De Jonge as Pricilla Richard Roxburgh as Vernon Presley Helen Thomson as Gladys and Kodi Smit-McPhee as Jimmie Rodgers Snow are all good but in my view could have been featured more .I personally think he lacks subtlety and while putting on a great show his script in this case focuses to much on the character of Colonel Tom Parker and as I recently referred to heroes as main characters in stories Colonel Tom Parker was no hero. Colonel Tom reminds me more of Rumpelstiltskin in more ways than one Elvis turned the straw that Colonel Tom Parker gave him into gold and like the Princess in the Grimm's Fairy Tale sadly Elvis paid a very high price.

One of those movies where right after the first sequence you know that you will watch it again and again.Movie lasts almost 3 hours but feels like only a few minutes have gone by. Right from the start you are on a roller coaster and there is no getting off till the end of the movie
That's typical Luhrmann that once again hasn't disappointed.I am glad this this music icon, the man who practically invented rock n roll, the King, was shown in a
respectful way and with the credit that this legend deserves, and that the actor has not gone into caricature. By the way, acting is brilliant! The moves, the walk, the voice- that's the closes to Elvis as you can get, without looking as Elvis impersonator.Movie is complex and yet very simple, with the moral point - listen to yourself. Be yourself. That's the only way you will be happy.

What a mess.... nearly incoherent storyline. Over 2.5 hours of film, yet after watching you know Elvis no better. It's simply a bunch scenes strung together, accompanied by music, but little to no plot and a complete lack of interesting dialog. The film feels almost like a bad fever dream, arbitrarily switching from scene to scene with little to no connection. Too much attention is put in Parker/Hanks, when he's not narrating he's the focus of every scene he's in. Thankfully Austin Butler and Olivia DeJonge do everything they can to save the train wreck, they still can only do so much, but both are fantastic with what they were given. The music varies, at times it's fantastic, others it's inappropriate and awkward.Absolute waste of Austin Butlers performance.

Firstly Austin Butler was great , he could actually be Elvis as he looked so much like him and clearly worked hard to do Elvis justice , but I didn't really enjoy the movie but can't put my finger on why , the Main actors did a good job but I couldn't really get an emotional connection with them or the story line until the very end , I thought the legend Tom Hanks had too much of a part to play and Elvis didn't get enough , the story seemed to bounce all over the place and to me just felt and bit disjointed , Im no movie critic or expert so I recommend seeing it as lots have really raved about it but I woo the be watching it again.

I normally love Baz Luhrmann's films but this was a chore to sit through. When I sit down to watch a film about Elvis I expect the soundtrack of the film to be full of Elvis music or even the music that inspired him. Why they decided to have this film filled with modern day hiphop/rap music is beyond me and it totally detracts from the story. Apart from that the acting in this makes it feel like a direct to dvd film you'd rent out of the redbox, even that from Tom Hanks! I had such a hard time getting through this 3 hour film, I honestly don't understand how it has such a high score.If you are a fan of the king I highly recommend watching Elvis from 1979 with Kurt Russell instead of this.

There are certainly times in which Baz Luhrmann's "Elvis" is an engaging and entertaining biopic of rock-and-roll's biggest star. The performance numbers are often incredible and Austin Butler inhabits all aspects/ages of the lead role adeptly. Unfortunately, Luhrmann's let's say "unique" style of filmmaking can't quite get out of its way long enough (especially in the early goings) for this to be a top-notch flick.For a very basic overview, "Elvis" tells the story of the titular character (played by Butler) from childhood all the way through his Vegas residency at the end of his career. The narrative frame comes from the voice of Colonel Parker (Tom Hanks), Presley's manager and quasi-abuser (largely in the financial department). Elvis's relationship to "black music", teen heartthrob fame, military service, and late-60s comeback are all given time here, including his marriage to Priscilla (Olivia DeJonge).Perhaps the most notable thing to mention about "Elvis" is that the first 30-45 minutes are kind of a mess. Luhrmann is in peak wackadoodle form (granted, what else could be expected from the director of 1996's "Romeo + Juliet"), what with jarring time-cuts, crazy montages (one that turns the proceedings into a comic book!), and quite a bit of time spent on the bizarre Hanks Parker portrayal. There is also a far-too-on-the-nose scene in which a young Presley supposedly learns his later musical style via an R&amp;B jam session and a revival ministry happening concurrently. I'd blame no one for thinking this was a total mess before the 1 hour mark.Fortunately, in this case, there is still 2 hours left of "Elvis", and that's when it settles into being a pretty entertaining film. Basically, once all the crazy material is out of the way and audiences can just settle into Butler's portrayal, there is a lot to like. I was really impressed with Butler's ability to portray the young rebellious Elvis, as well as the fat, worn-down-by-life version. The staged musical numbers are every bit as good as those found in recent musical biopics like Rocketman or Bohemian Rhapsody. I'll certainly be revisiting some Presley tunes after seeing this.Overall, I can't put "Elvis" in my top tier (Walk the Line, Love &amp; Mercy, &amp; Judy) of biopics because its director seems almost physically unable to "tell it straight" when this film and acting performances would have certainly been good enough for that grounded approach. But it was easily good enough to hold my interest and take me on an interesting journey through the iconic musician's entire career.

I normally am not a fan of Baz Luhrman. I am a huge Elvis fan. I was ready to hate it based on my distaste for his other works. But I was enraptured. This movie is going to sweep the Oscars. I was crying at the end, you can tell Baz Luhrman loves Elvis. Thank you, Baz. This was a joy to experience.

Elvis is really something to behold. It's over-the-top, gluttonously indulgent, shamelessly embellished, dizzying, loud, flashy and in-your-face for the greater part of 2 and a 1/2 hours. But is it entertaining as hell? You betcha. Elvis Presley, somewhere, is smiling down on this gaudy, golden-encrusted tribute of his. This doesn't feel like the biopic of a man, or an artist, but rather, a mythical Greek god. If ever you wanted the King to get his epic due on the big screen, Baz Luhrmann has delivered it in spades. He may have been the best, and only director capable of making an Elvis biopic. But of course, you will need to suspend your disbelief and go for the ride that Baz takes you on. You may need to bring a barf-bag. Elvis quickly breezes through the King's life, from his childhood in Tulepo, MS, to his glory days in Memphis, to the days in captivity in Las Vegas. Shadowing him throughout is Colonel Tom Parker, his devious, greedy and fame-starved manager. He is played here by Tom Hanks. Folks, I don't even know where to begin. This is easily his worst performance ever. He's less reminiscent of the real man, and more like an Andy Kaufman character. That makeup, that accent... my god, man. What were they thinking? It takes you completely out of the movie. Luckily, Elvis is so freewheeling in that classic Baz Lurhmann style, it's easy to forget how bad Hanks is here. Austin Butler on the other hand is a fabulous Elvis. He goes above and beyond your average impersonator, let me tell you. He looks nothing like Elvis, and you still can believe him in the role. We go through his life, through every phase, and yet, we never go deep enough. Sorely underrepresented was his downfall in the 1970's, which, if explored in all of its tragedy, could have put this film on a whole other level. But perhaps that messes with the Elvis myth. Perhaps that would've reminded us that Elvis is and was as human as we all are. Lurhmann clearly disagrees. A mixed bag, but it's a blast. God love the music. The music, the music, the music.

Man O Man.A Frantic Fast paced Concert Like Cinematic Experience With The Production and Direction Levels Of The Very Highest Order.Key Points -1. First Off, The lead. Austin Butler looks absolutely Beautiful to look at. His Performance in this Couldn't of been any better. His Mannerisms and Movements were so Good.2. Then we Have Tom Hanks, What A performer he is. He's Just as Crucial to This Movie as Austin Butler is.3. The Style of this Movie is Awesome. The Fast Pace, The Dialogue, The little cuts, The Text Graphics, the panoramic shots of Las Vegas and City Hotels. Everything, it's just a Joy To Watch.4. The Musical Scenes, I saw this in Dolby Cinema and it was Absolutely Blaring with Sound And Bass. It felt like I was at a Concert.5. Finally the Storyline. It's the Rise and Fall of Elvis Presley and Boy, What a Ride it was.Overall, Just Excellent.

It all feels disjointed. Everything is over the top. Even Tom Hanks, who speaks like those cartoon villains that say "Mwahaha" in the end speak.The modern hip hop soundtrack solidified the director's approach and sinks the movie even lower.

Compared to other musical biopics that have hit the screen in recent years (Rocket Man, Bohemian Rhapsody), 'Elvis' is tad underwhelming. It is a solid film but Luhrmann's direction failed to fully draw me in and impress.There is a lot to like about this film however. Austin Butler gives a truly terrific performance and thoroughly shines in the role. He is so charismatic and really embodies everything that Elvis was. Hanks on the other hand is reduced to a bit of a caricature which really didn't work for me. A shame as I am normally a huge fan of Hanks but felt like this casting was a little off.Perhaps the biggest draw back for me was the style of film making. The opening 30-40 minutes were very chaotic. The non-linear story telling made the opening act feel unnecessarily messy. Once things were unravelled and we started progressing through Elvis' life chronologically, things somehow felt drawn out yet fleeting at the same time. I think Luhrmann missed the mark on this one a bit.I also would have liked to have seen more from a musical perspective. At times the film had the wrong focus and I think it failed to capture just how and why Elvis became the icon he was.Despite this the film does a good job of exploring over 20 years of Elvis' life, which is no mean feat. There are some fantastic sequences and brilliant costume work throughout.Elvis is a solid film and there is a lot to enjoy, but I was expecting more and feel like with such an interesting story to tell this film could have and should have been better.

There are elements of this film that are really good, but there is sadly more of it that is utter nonsense. That's a shame and there is a narrative hidden in here to appease the BLM/Woke generation. Elvis was no activist, but he did grow up among black people and was heavily inspired by the culture, especially gospel.But why embellish it with nonsense that will inevitably come out as such and thus undermine the contribution of black artists to what Elvis eventually becomes? The reason is the makers of the film want this to appeal to a younger woke generation and present Elvis as a civil rights angel, while brushing over his extensive drug use, his questionable (and quite frankly inappropriate) relationship with minors (although the likes of Chuck Berry, Jimmy Page and David Bowie etc. Were no better) and involvement with the mafia.So lets get some things straight:<ul><li>B. B King and Elvis were not best mates. Interviews from B. B suggest they met a handful of times and only in the studio - not as the film suggests where B. B is almost like a mentor.</li></ul><ul><li>Tom Parker did not have an accent like that.</li></ul><ul><li>Elvis never sang "Trouble" at the Memphis show because the song wasn't even written yet. He also wasn't pulled off stage in a riot like situation. The breaking of segregation lines is a bit more embellished too, although Elvis did break some of those boundaries merely by making black music popular so other white people saw that they could enjoy it too.</li></ul><ul><li>The Christmas special bit where they present the Colonel as being double crossed is also proper nonsense. Furthermore - the Colonel never asked Elvis to dial down his gyrations; he encouraged them as he knew it made them money.</li></ul><ul><li>Neither the Robert Kennedy or MLK assassination impacted the filming of the.68 special. There was also no Christmas set.</li></ul>There is plenty of other rubbish put into the movie. You have to think - "why add in a load of made up stuff for one of the most interesting and best entertainers that ever lived?".Why add in rap music to some of the scenes - that was a terrible idea when there is so much good R&amp;B music. Again this is just to appeal to the younger tik tok generation.The real King of rock N' Roll is Little Richard but you won't see a big Hollywoke movie on him because he was a devout Christian and eventually gave up his life to live quietly and as Christ like as possible. His last video (available on utube) is quite an incredible testimony. This may also explain why James Burtons (Ronnie Tutt ect.) name isn't mentioned too, despite how instrumental he was in the Vegas years. All devout believers - which Elvis was too, but we hear very little on that.Butler is great in this, but sadly the embellishment leaves a bitter taste in the mouth.

Elvis (2022) :
Movie Review -Director Baz Luhrmann has teamed up with Austin Butler and Tom Hanks to tell the dramatic life story of one of the greatest singers ever to perform on stage. The musical biographical drama takes you to the Elvis Presley era and leaves you spellbound with his memories. Dubbed as the King of Rock and Roll, Elvis is recognised by the Guinness Book of World Records as the best-selling solo music artist of all time. The man has inspired many, entertained millions, and has been loved by even more people. He deserved a biopic befitting his stature, and we can only thank Luhrmann for providing him with an expedient tribute in the form of this film. Elvis will not only entertain you, but it will also leave you mesmerised over Presley's memories. If you're a fan of Elvis Presley (who's not?), then make sure you catch this great musical show in cinemas near you.The film chronicles the life and career of singer and actor Elvis Presley (Austin Butler), from his early days as a child to becoming a rock and roll star and movie star, as well as his complex relationship with his manager, Colonel Tom Parker (Tom Hanks). It also showcases his family life, including his married life with wife Priscilla Presley (Olivia DeJonge). Elvis was a controversial figure in the media due to racial issues in America. His sexually provocative wiggling and over-energized interpretations made him popular among female audiences, but they also brought him a lot of criticism from political and extreme Americanized socialists. Baz Luhrmann and Jeremy Doner's writing takes care of all things to present you with a spicy story which fits into mainstream cinema's template. Sam Bromell and Craig Pearce add fantastic support to the writing duo in this screenplay, which is damn too long (almost 160 minutes), but never tedious.The first and most important department in the biographical dramas is the acting unit. Everyone has to look like the real characters and should be comfortable with the transformations. What Austin Butler does on screen is nothing but Magic! Without any doubt, Mr. Butler, Elvis is your best performance so far and will remain one of the best and most memorable ones when you retire. Every frame, expression, and dance step he makes will remind you of Elvis Presley. He is that close. Supporting him is none other than one of the best actors of his generation, Mr. Tom Hanks. I don't know why, but I kind of liked this idea that Elvis's story is told by a sort of antagonist and not the protagonist. Hanks has got quite a changeover in his looks and voice for this character, and he is just superb. Elvis's parents are played by Helen Thomson and Richard Roxburgh, and they have a few good scenes. Olivia DeJonge looks gorgeous as his wife, though her performance doesn't show up over the heavy make-up (even though that was mandatory).The second and third most important things about a biopic are production design and technical aspects. Elvis looks lavish though, but it has a few glitches that appear in the beginning with the art design. However, the technical aspects recover the loss, and how! The music is foot-tapping, and so is the background score. You can't expect anything less in this department, and Elliott Wheeler gives you just what you want. Mandy Walker moves the camera smartly and captures many great frames. The editing boosts the final impact with colour and B &amp; W, mixed transitions, and footage-like scenes.Bazz Luhrmann has been a very picky man when it comes to directing films. He hasn't directed a handful of movies. He did a countable and a couple of them are really good. His last work was "The Great Gatsby". Well, that was almost a decade ago. That's his best work to date, and may remain so, but Elvis is very close to Gatsby. Now, does that make it clear to you? Yes, Elvis is almost as close to The Great Gatsby as it gets, and it's more authentic, in spite of missing many controversial and infamous events from Presley's life. Luhrmann's sense of cinema is vivid and neat, and that's what I like about him. 8 years of research and he makes a worthy biopic of a music legend, not for himself, but for us. For fans. So, don't miss it. Elvis Presley fans just can't miss it. But even the ones who don't know much about him but want to know, can't miss it. Thank you, Elvis Presley, for providing us with music that we will never forget, and thank you, Baz Luhrmann, for providing a fulfilling cinematic gratitude to the King of Rock and Roll. When words are too difficult to say, sing them. So, let's all sing together with him.RATING - 7/10*

There is a lot to unpack about what I did not like about this movie but I also feel I need to 'fess up about my love of Elvis and growing up a fan as a child. I was 11 when he died and it came as a big shock. In rural Norfolk where we lived mostly 20 years in the past so it seemed that he had only just arrived. I spent a long time after following the legend. The Kurt Russel movie, the odd "That's the Way it is / Was" documentaries - stylistically plundered for this movie and of course all the movies. Owning 40 Greatest Hits was pretty much issued to you growing up. Then Punk Rock and New Wave came and Elvis just became the distant past, even if he did shock his audience in a way Johnny Rotten could only dream. Occasionally American Trilogy would come on the radio and I'd crank it up and do an Elvis impersonator sing-along, "Wisha was, inna lanna cotton" I played it on my excited drive to see this movie I had been waiting for, saying to my partner, "If this song is not referenced in the movie, I'll be stunned, it is definitive Elvis".Once the film started, it was the first track we see enacted by the incredibly brilliant Austin Butler who nails it. Sadly, there is not much else good to say about this movie beyond his performance. It makes sense of course that Baz Luhrmann would open with that. Luhrmann is never one to use a nutcracker when there is a sledgehammer he can bang an idea a few times with until you get it. That's my point. This is not really an Elvis movie. It is a Tom Parker movie that wishes it was an Elvis movie. I am not sure you can be that dark and cynical about Elvis life and hope to get away with it considering what baggage the typical audience are likely to bring to the show. For Elvis to be portrayed as this easily manipulated kid, when anyone who watched the documentaries mentioned above knew The King was always in charge. If you tip the weight of the narrative to Colonel Tom you have to reduce the personality of Elvis. Don't get me wrong when I first heard rumours about this movie I was very keen for a Colonel Tom movie played by Tom Hanks but for that movie to work it needs a less important Elvis, that's a tough trick to pull off.This movie is only coherent to an Elvis fan. To others not plugged into the folklore, myth and legend, it is long and boring with Luhrmann over egging his point and being cynical and depressive. He either fast forwards too much that is relevant or dwells on insignificance to bolster and pad out the Colonel Tom con artist. There is the art of the conman, the huckster, referenced through this movie. In reality, the biggest card trick is shuffled by the director who promises us a celebration of Elvis but delivers a woeful, tedious tale of a mediocre manager who got lucky clinging to a rocket after it had already launched. Butler is brilliant, no doubt, Hanks is hammy at best. Luhrmann tries to use Elvis to paint Tom Parker which is like I said, using a sledgehammer to crack a nut.Fun in places but subtle it ain't. Thang yer verry mush.

It's like Austin Butler was no more and I just saw Elvis Presley, you clearly see he did his homework on the man, and it pays off in his performance. Some say he got overshadowed by Tom Hanks who plays Colonel Parker, but I have to disagree, don't get me wrong, Hanks was good has Parker, but I never thought for a second that he overshadowed Butler in anyway.Hanks and Butler really had such a dynamic on screen, both really clicked. The musical numbers really come alive when they happen. Olivia Dejonge also shines has Priscella. Baz Luhrmann's direction is pretty trippy and at time disorienting, but effect.

I can't believe these reviews. This was horrible. This was tedious and boring. This dude was the worst elvis impersonator in the history of Elvis impersonators. I could not get I past Elvis. Hanks looked like Roseanne tv husband. But in a sin city kinda way. God this was horrible. I just got an acting gig. The director told me to watch this cause it's great. What do I tell him now. I'm gonna have to Lie.

There are way better Elvis movies out there than this one. It almost seems cartoonish. Hell, Elvis meets Nixon blows this movies away! It seems to me the writers and producers just borrowed scenes from all the other Elvis movies and other movies like Great Balls of Fires and The Buddy Holly story which have similarities to them. There was even a great scene in Martin Scorsese's HBO series Vinyl with Elvis, The Colonel and Jerry Canavale. Don't waste your time with another waste of millions of dollars. To quote many actors in Hollywood, the budget of this movie could've ended world hunger or least fed a few million people......

Laying it on thick here - no pun intended. Actually you won't see much of the ... bodily impaired/troubled (is that the politicaly correct way to say it?) Evlis. You won't see too much critique of his using music (stealing it?) from colored folk. Quite the opposite, you will see his perspective on things. Actually just going back to his childhood and where he grew up, should shut most of the discussion down.Of course it will be something the movie will mention. Like the very first time Tom Hanks as Colonal hears Elvis sing - he thinks he must be a man of color. The movie is all over the place (again no pun intended) - we go back and forth, to get to know Elvis more than just a little bit. The 2,5 hours really pass by quite quickly.Austin Butler is Elvis - when I say that, I am aware that there might be others who may look even more like Elvis when it comes to the physical appearance. But when it comes to the complete package - Austin is as good as they come ... and sing and act. He really gave it his all. This is a performance of a life time. The Colonal sometimes feels like a caricature, but I imagine that is the way he talks. You may also feel that the first time Elvis moves his ... pelvis, the way women reacted was too over the top. But imagine them being closed off (and clothed off) and then see all that sexual energy thrown their way - yes I am sure many women had their first time with Elvis. Maybe even in physical form (though that part is also kept to a minimum in the movie itself).I am not what many would call a Baz Luhrman fan - but I don't think there was a better director, someone more suited for this job right here. Visually stunning, with all the greatest hits (and the some) and as we came to know some newer twist on the whole music tracks. So don't be mad if you hear a song and then you realize it is a newer remix.This is really something that Elvis or his legacy is deserving of. And another great movie released in 2022 - keep em coming. Elvis may have left the bulding, but he'll always be in our hearts and homes!

This was your usual Hollywood movie lately. Slow. Boring.They also had to bring in certain aspects...always mentioning race which is old.This is the first role ever I did not like Tom Hanks in.Seemed more like a made for TV movie than a big budget one.2/10- Same ole crap people are getting sick of.

Agonizingly surrealistic, semi-psychodelic and jerky beginning, followed by one depressing scene after another, all to the narration of a drawling Tom Hanks, as if that were supposed to give this ridiculous excuse for entertainment some sort of pedigree.A film-school-project quality direction combined with a new-age trying-hard-to-be-edgy/arty screenplay that combine to spew out the story-telling slop that results, all while the rap-infused soundtrack blares on. Maybe Hanks will also stoop to narrate a new-age dish-all-the-dirt story-telling of "Marilyn."P. S. Effusive "10" fake/shill reviews by new/recent IMDB members abound as a smokescreen to hide what a POS this tripe is.

What a gorgeous, exhilarating, heart breaking film. Austin Butler must be channeling the spirit of The King - his dancing, his voice, his singing, it's all such a beautiful tribute to a legendary performer. The pace of the movie is frantic, in Baz Luhrman's typical style. I got a bit tired of the Colonel's narration, but in a way it adds to the feel of the awful control the man had over Elvis and his career. It's a stunning achievement that could not have been made if Butler didn't perfect his performance. Loved it.

This film is the first great biopic about Elvis Presley's life. The film starts with Colonel Tom Parker telling his story on his death bed. We flashback to Elvis in Vegas and early in his career. The film is very flashy which is typical of Baz Lurhmann's style. We see flashbacks to his childhood and what influenced him early was black gospel music. He loved the superhero Captain Marvel and wanted to be a superhero himself. Austin Butler really embodies Elvis's spirit in this film he had the moves down, the look the voice, everything. Early in Elvis's career he moved his pelvis around and made young girls scream. The conservatives wanted to put him in jail for corrupting the young youth. Parker decided to put him in the army and send him off to Germany in 1959. That is where his life changed and he met a 14 year old Priscilla. When he got back he got into movies and restarted his career. He married Priscilla and they had Lisa Marie. His career had started to wane by the late 60's. But the 1968 comeback special he did revamped his career. With some great performances. My favorite was If I Can Dream. Butler is spectacular playing Elvis in so many different stages of his life. I loved the production design, the costumes and the music. The fast paced editing may dizzy some people at times but I think Baz knows how tell a great story on a grand scale. We all know that Elvis's life had a sad ending. His story is worthy of Shakespearean nature. Colonel Tom Parker took advantage of him and many possibly blame him for Elvis's death. What we need to remember is Elvis was a once in a life time talent that gave us a lot of joy. I have to mention Olivia DeJonge who was very good as Priscilla she really looked like her and embodied her spirit. She is an actress to watch in the future. Tom Hanks did a good job at Parker who discovered Elvis but also hurt his career as well. I really enjoyed this film and think it was a great biopic done right. I think Butler should get an Oscar nomination and it is one of the best films of 2022 so far.

It's a bit like Big Fish but without the story or acting talent , if you love movie length music videos with no story you'll love this , managed and hour before we had to switch off , Hanks is just annoying as Parker.
